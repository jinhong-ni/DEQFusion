OK BUT THE TWO BIG CHARACTER APPEARANCES IN THIS MOVIE ARE EASILY DEADPOOL AND GAMBIT	0.6
ACTUALLY I LIKED HIM A LOT	2.0
AND I THOUGHT HE MADE A GOOD ACTOR FOR THE DEAD POOR CHARACTER	1.8
NOW HES SEEN AT THE BEGINNING THAT REALLY SOLD ME	2.6
NOW THE TITLE OF THE MOVIE BASICALLY SAYS IT ALL	-0.4
MY REASON IM A COMIC BOOK FAN	-0.2
NOW IM NOT EVEN GONNA SUGAR COAT THIS THIS MOVIE FRUSTRATED ME TO SUCH AN EXTREME EXTENT THAT I WAS LOUDLY EXCLAIMING WHY AT THE END OF THE FILM	-2.8
THAT HUH BEFORE WE GO ON WITH THAT I MUST SAY THAT THIS HAD A SURPRISINGLY DECENT CAST 	0.8
THAT LIKE TO SEE COMIC BOOK CHARACTERS TREATED RESPONSIBLY	-1.4
NOW HUGH JACKMAN WAS ALWAYS THE BEST CHOICE TO PLAY WOLVERINE I WILL ADMIT THAT	1.8

AND UM MICHAEL SHEEN AS ARO AS WELL HE WAS RATHER ENJOYABLE TO WATCH	1.8
AND THE SCRIPT IT LEFT ALL THE KEY PLOTS AND EMOTION FROM THE CHARACTERS TO BE EXPOSED THROUGH DIALOGUE	0.4
I THINK IT WAS EMPIRE MAGAZINES REVIEW OF NEW MOON THAT SAID THAT KRISTEN RELIED HEAVILY ON THE TACTIC OF TACTIC OF BLINKING A LOT WHICH SHE REALLY DOES DO A LOT	-0.4
BUT AT THE SAME GOES FOR ROB PATTINSON AS EDWARD AND TAYLOR LAUTNER AS JACOB THEY DO A LOT OF FROWNING IM A MANLY MAN AND I FROWN	-0.2
FOR THE MOMENT IN THIS THE WHOLE CINEMA WAS LAUGHTING	1.8
AND I THINK THE VOLTURI THAT WAS MY EXCITING BIT OF THE ENTIRE FILM	1.2
THE REST OF THE FILM WAS JUST WATCHING KRISTEN JUST MOB AROUND 	-1.4
AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE AVERAGE	-0.4
I THOUGHT TWILIGHT DIRECTED BY CATHERINE HARDWICKE WAS ACTUALLY REALLY RATHER ENJOYABLE	2.0
LETS FACE IT THEY ARE REALLY NOT MASTER PIECES	-1.75

I THOUGHT THAT FILM WAS AWFUL	-2.4
THE THING IS ITS A VERY GOOD TRANSLATION OF THE BOOK	2.2
OVERALL NEW MOON WAS IT WAS OK JUST AVERAGE	0.6
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT LOYALTY	1.4
ITS VERY VERY LOYAL TO THE BOOK 	1.6
AND THE BOOK IS NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST THRILLING BOOK EVER	-1.4
UM HOWEVER IT IS THIS LOYALTY TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE THAT GIVES IT ITS FLAWS	-0.2
IT WASNT REALLY THE BEST THE MOST THRILLING READ EVER ILL SAY THAT	-1.4

OVERALL I REALLY ENJOYED COWBOYS AND ALIENS	2.0
NOT A HUGE FLAW BUT ITS THERE AND ITS NOTICABLE	-1.4
THE ACTION IS REALLY INTENSE WHICH SURPRISED ME 	2.2
AND ITS SATISFACTORY	0.8

BECAUSE I MEAN IF HES ABLE TO DO ALL OF THIS SORT OF STUFF LIKE HOW YOURE SUPPOSED TO REALLY PUT UP A FORCE THAT CAN PUSH HIM TO THE NEXT LEVEL OR OR DESTROY HIM AT THE SAME TIME	0.0
AND IT DOES KIND OF A LEA HELPS ALLEVIATE WHAT THAT WHOLE WAS IS ABOUT FIGHTING THE ULTIMATE ENEMY WITHIN THIS FIRST MOVIE AND THAT THE THREAT IS STILL THERE POTENTIALLY SPEAKING	1.4
BUT I THINK THERE WAS ALSO SOME SORT OF LIKE UM TONE WITHIN THE ACTUAL UM POWERS OF THE GREEN LANTERN AND HIMSELF AND THAT YOU CAN BASICALLY THINK UP OF ANYTHING AND YOU CAN PROJECT THAT INTO THE REAL LIFE 	0.8
AND I THINK HAVING THIS SORT OF SUPERPOWER ALMOST THIS POWER TO JUST IMAGINE ANYTHING KIND OF JUST UM HELPED ME GET PASSED THAT YOU KNOW THESE ARE ALL CGI CHARACTERS AND SET	1.0
THIS IS A PLAYGROUND AND THEIR IMAGINARY PLAYGROUND AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN ANYTHING THAT WHAT ALSO MADE THE FILM EXCITING	2.2
BECAUSE YOU DONT ENTIRELY KNOW WHATS COMING NEXT	0.2

I JUST GOT FINISHED WATCHING AN EXCELLENT MOVIE CALLED MARS NEEDS MOMS	3.0
I LIKED GRIBBLE BECAUSE HE HELPED MILO GET MILOS MOTHER AWAY FROM THE ALIANS	1.8
AND MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS IN THE MOVIE WOULD HAVE TO BE MILO MILOS MOTHER AND GRIBBLE	2.0
AND MY FAVORITE PART IN THE MOVIE WAS WHEN MILO HAS TO SAVE GRIBBLE	2.2
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS AWESOME	2.8
BECAUSE IT IS A GOOD MOVIE	2.2
AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR AGES 3 AND UP	2.0
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE MY BROTHER IS FIVE YEARS OLD AND HE DIDNT THINK THIS MOVIE WAS SCARY AT ALL	-0.4
AND IT DEPENDS WHAT AGE YOU ARE AND HOW YOU TO HOW YOU FEEL LIKE SEE THE MOVIE	0.8
BEACUSE I WANTED TO SEE HOW THEY COULD FRAME THAT 	0.25

BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU IF YOUR TOP PRIORITY IS SURVIVAL THAN WHY WOULD YOU BE WORRIED ABOUT HAVING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN	-0.6
LIKE TH THIS THING ISNT REALLY A BIG DEAL BUT UM I I DDINT LIKE THE FACT THAT JOHN HAD AN IPHONE	-1.2
BUT MY OPININ LIKE HE SHOULDNT HAVE AN IPHONE HE SHOULDNT CARE ABOUT THE LATEST TRENDS SO THATS REALLY WHAT THE LIEUTENANT XXX	-1.6
SO SINCE WERE NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION IS THEY COULD BE LIKE SCRAPING BY OR THEY COULD BE TOTALLY RICH	0.0
UM LIKE I SAID IT WASNT BIG DEAL	-0.4
I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL TOO COMMERCIAL IN THAT ASPECT	-0.2
UM ANOTHER THING THAT DID BOTHER ME WERE THE KISSINGS 	-1.2
AND YOU PROBABLY DONT THINK SO BUT YOU KNOW JUST ONE OF THOSE LITTLE THINGS THAT THAT HURT YOU FOR SOME REASON YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN	-1.6

SO THIS WAS PRETTY FUNNY 	1.4
UM THERE COULDVE BEEN LESS BLUE NUDITY 	-1.6
I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY FUNNY	1.6
IT WAS FUNNY THOUGH	1.8
BECAUSE WHAT WAS WEIRD WAS THE FACT THAT IN PART OF THE MOVIE HES WEARING LIKE A BLUE UM OVERALL FLONG THING MEDAL FLONG THING SO I WAS LIKE WHY NOT WEAR THE WHOLE WHOLE TIME YOU KNOW WHY WHY YOU GOT TO GO COMMAND ON US 	-1.2
BUT UM YOU KNOW OVERALL IT WAS GOOD	1.8
UM SO AT THE END THERES NOT REALLY A WHOLE LOT OF REDEEMING VALUE THAT I THINK YOU COME UP WITH	-1.8
ITS KIND OF WEIRD	-1.0
HES FUNNY	2.0
ALL RIGHT SO ENOUGH OF THE NUDITY	-1.6
I DONT KNOW CLASSIC SUPERHERO KIND OF GETTING ON KIND OF THING	0.6
UM JUNIOR LADY GIRL I KNOW I I MEAN SHE LOOKED FAN FANTASTIC	-0.4
UM BUT WHAT SUCKED WHAT WAS BAD WAS MALIN AKERMAN THE GIRL WHO PLAYS THE SILK SPECTRE II	-2.2
SHE LOOKED LIKE A SUPERHERO	0.8
SHE LOOKED PHENOMENAL	2.2
AND THERES A VAST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS 	-0.2
BUT SHE ACTED LIKE POWER RANGER	-0.4
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED	2.2
BUT UM HE DID A REALLY GOOD JOB AT ACTING	2.2
AND IT SEEMED LIKE EVERYTHING WAS SORT OF OVERWHELMINGLY BAD	-1.6
AND UM THERES NOT IN MY OPINION THERE WASNT VERY MUCH OF A BALANCE BETWEEN SORT OF LIKE THE GOOD EVIL KIND OF THING	-1.6
I WARN YOU ITS A VERY VERY DARK 	-1.0
UM BUT ITS EXTREMELY DARK	-0.6
AND ITS VERY VERY INTERESTING	1.4
SO OVERALL ITS ITS LIKE A BLEND OF YOUVE GOT ALTERNATIVE HISTORY	0.6
OVERALL OVERALL IT HAD FAR TOO MANY PLOT HOLES	-1.8
AND JUST NOT ENOUGH DEPTH TO BE INTERESTING	-2.2
I HAVE TO SAY MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE IS THE CHARACTER THOMPSON	2.0
BUT HES JUST THE CREEPIEST OLD GUY YOULL EVER SEE IN YOUR LIFE HE STANDS OVER PEOPLE WHEN THEYRE ASLEEP JUST STARING AT THEM	-1.0
WHICH IS WHERE ALL GREAT RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD START 	0.4
I LITERALLY SAID OUT LOUD WHAT QUE WHAT IS THIS MOVIE THAT I AM SEEING WHAT IS THIS	-2.4
AND JUST ITS VERY ITS VERY CHAOTIC AT THE END OF THIS MOVIE	-1.0
BUT THERES A REASON FOR THAT THERES A REASON FOR WHY I WAS CONFUSED	-0.2
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE	-2.0
THANKS A LOT COMMERCIAL	-1.4
FIRST OFF THE COMMERCIAL MAKES THE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MISTAKE OF SAYING THAT IT IS MORE THOUGHT PROVOKING THAN INCEPTION	-2.6
BUT I MUST SAY THOSE ARE SOME PRETTY BIG SHOES TO FILL SO I THOUGHT MAYBE IT HAS A CHANCE	0.4
THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS CONSTANTLY COMPARING IT TO INCEPTION	-0.2
I WAS JUST WAITING FOR JOSEPH GORDON LEVITT TO COME OUT JUST JUMP OUT ANY TIME AND SAY ITS A PARADOX	-0.5
I I SHOULD GIVE IT A SHOT YOU KNOW	0.6
WHICH KIND OF JUST RUINS THE SUSPENSE RIGHT THERE BECAUSE IF YOUVE GOT SOME CONVENIENT GUY IN A FEDORA TO JUST TELL YOU OH YES WE ARE THE ADJUSTEMENT BUREAU AND THIS IS WHAT WE DO YOU KNOW ITS JUST KIND OF RUINS THE SUSPENSE	-2.2
NOW THE ONLY SUSPENSFUL PART THAT I FOUND IN THE FIRST THIRTY MINUTES OF THE MOVIE WAS WHEN MATT DAMON FIRST DISCOVERS THE BUREAU IN THE FIRST PLACE	-0.8
INTERESTINGLY IT TURNED OUT TO BE MORE OF A ROMANTIC COMEDY THAN IT WAS A THRILLER	0.0
AND NOW IM NOT IM NOT EXCITED ANYMORE	-1.4
YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS FUNNY AT TIMES	1.0
UM YOU KNOW IT HAD SOME INTERESTING WRITING	0.6
BUT JUST ASIDE FROM THAT THEY REALLY DROPPED THE BALL ON THE SUSPENSFUL PARTS	-2.2
MATT DAMON IS A YOU KNOW HES A PRETTY FUNNY GUY	1.4
BUT HE ACTUALLY FOUND UM WHEN HES SEEN COME UP IT SLOWED THE MOVIE DOWN UM AND THIS IS THE PROBLEM UM WITH PREDATOR TO PREDATORS COMPARED TO PREDATOR	-1.4
PREDATOR IS REALLY WELL PACED MOVIE	1.8
AND IT PICKS UP SPEED AND NEVER LETS GO EV EVEN IN THE SAME XXX WHERE THEY THEY SLOW YOU KNOW THEY MEANT TO HAVE SOME DIALOGUE AND AND TALK ABOUT WHATS GOING ON YO YOU KNOW 	1.0
IT FELT THE MOVIE SLOWED DOWN WHERES IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS	-1.4
UM HE HAD SOME FUNNY HE HAD A FEW ONE LINES THAT WAS QUITE QUITE FUNNY	1.2
YEAH ONCE UNFORTUNATELY UM I THINK IN THE WRITING SOMEWHERE THEY THEY JUST WERENT UM DEVELOPED ENOUGH FEAR TO CARE ABOUT THEM UM AND THAT INCLUDES IS IT TOPHER GRACES I THINK I THINK HIS NAME WAS INCLUDS HIS CHARACTER UM	-2.0
UM I JUST DIDNT THINK IT WAS WELL DEVELOPED ENOUGH AND UM I ALSO I I INCLUDE IN THAT LAURENCE FISHBURNES CHARACTER AS WELL 	-1.0
WHO I THINK RODRIGEZ WHEN HE WROTE THE MO WROTE THE MOVIE WAS GOING FOR A MARLON BRANDO APOCALIPSE NOW TYPE OF CHARACTER	-0.4
WHEN WHEN THEY THEY WITH UM LAURENCE FISHBURNE CHARACTER IT DOES SLOW DOWN A GREAT DEAL	-0.8
I DIDNT REALLY FEEL UM THE INCLUSION OF HIS CHARATER WAS NECESSARY	-1.4
UM IM GONNA GIVE THE REASONS WHY I LIKE HIM 	1.2
UM WHICH I THINK RODRIGEZ WAS GOING FOR HE TH TH HE ALWAYS SAID THAT HE WAS GONNA DO THE SEQUEL UM HE WANTED THIS TO BE UM TH THE PREDATOR EQUIVALENT OF ALIENS	-0.2
BUT MOSTLY IM GONNA GIVE THE REASONS OF WHY I DONT THINK HES GONNA BE A CLASSIC IN THE SAME WAY AS THE FIRST MOVIE PREDATOR OR ALIENS	-0.8
UM AND IM GONNA REALLY POINT OUT WHY THAT I DONT THINK HE REALLY PULLED HE PULLED THAT OFF	-2.0
UM AS UM YOU KNOW AS ALIENS WAS TO ALIEN 	-0.2
UM BUT I DID ENJOY IT	0.2
UM WHY WAS A MISTAKE REALLY TO TRY AND DO THAT 	-1.5
THE CHARACTERS WERE WELL DEVELOPED UM NOT ALL OF THE CHARACTERS	1.4
SO UM IM GONNA POINT OUT THE STUFF I DID LIKE THERE WERE SOME ACTION SCENES IN IT	1.2
UM I I LIKED AGENT BRODYS CHARACTER	1.6
BUT UM I WOULD SAY THAT UM THERE WAS THERES GOOD THERE WERE FOUR GOOD CHARACTERS IN THERE 	0.6
YOU KNOW WELL DRAWN OUT CHARACTER	1.4
I THOUGHT HE WAS UM WELL DEVELOPED	1.6
I LIKED THE GIRL WHO WAS THE ISRAELI SNIPER	0.8
SOMEONE YOU CARED ABOUT	0.0
UM I LIKED THE RUSSIAN GUY JURI 	1.0
I THOUGHT SHE WAS THE NUMBER ONE WELL DRAWN CHARACTER	1.2
AND XXX WAS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER 	1.6
UM YOU CARED YOU THERE WAS ENOUGH IN THERE FOR YOU TO CARE ABOUT HIM	0.6
UM IT COULDVE BEEN WRITTEN OUT	-0.8
I MEAN THIS MOVIE MAKES UM MAKES UM STAR WARS PRETTY CLOSE	0.0
I MEAN ITS ITS ABOUT THAT LEVEL STAR WAR IS 	0.2
PRETTY CLOSE AS FAR AS JUST CGI HEAVY LIKE THIS TIME ITS WHAT ITS LIKE HUMAN FACE AND EVERYTHING AROUND THAT FACE IS CARTOON CGI COMPUTER EFFECTS 	-1.2
AND THATS BECAUSE ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH THE MOVIE I REALIZED THAT THIS IS JUST ITS REALLY JUST A CARTOON	-0.8
IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A LIVE ACTION MOVIE YOU YOURE GONNA BE DISAPPOINTED	-2.0
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A CARTOON WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH MOSTLY IS WITH ALL THE CGI FX	-1.0
AND AND THERE IS A LOT OF IT 	-0.333333333333
AND UM I HAVE TO ADMIT I WAS WATCHING THIS I PURPOSLY PUT IT ON BECAUSE I FIGURED IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE STUPID THAT I COULD FALL ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF AND NOT MISS TOO MUCH	-1.4
SO I DIDNT DIDNT HAVE VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS MOVIE 	-1.6
JUST WANTED SOMETHING TO WATCH WHILE I WAS FALLING ASLEEP 	-0.4
BECAUSE I THREE MAJOR COMPLAINTS I HAVE ABOUT THIS MOVIE	-1.4
AND I UM PRETTY MUCH IT PRETTY MUCH MET MY LOW EXPECTATIONS FOR THE MOST PART	-1.4
AND UM THE STORY WAS PRETTY WEIRD	-1.6
UM BIGGEST ONE IS THE CGI EFFECTS WERE JUST TERRIBLE 	-2.6
AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN IT MIGHT HAVE MADE MORE SENSE 	-1.0
UM AND AGAIN I I IF I HAD TO PAY CLOSER ATTENTION I MIGHT HAVE FOLLOWED IT MORE	-0.8
WHICH I MEAN FOR A MOVIE ABOUT JI JOE NINTY MINUTES IS ENOUGH	-0.8
UM UM THIS MOVIE THIS MOVIE UM BY HALF WAY THROUGH I WAS CHECKING THE TIME AND SAW THAT THIS MOVIE WAS TWO HOURS LONG	-2.2
BUT THATS JUST ME	-0.333333333333
OK I DONT NEED A THREE HOUR MINI XXX ABOUT JI JOE	-2.0
AND THE LAST BIG THING WAS UM JUST THE THE IT IT I KNOW ITS ABOUT JIJOE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY ITS GONNA BE ABOUT THE ARMY BUT IT JUST FELT LIKE UM LIKE UM MILITARY PROPAGANDA KIND OF LIKE YOU KNOW	-1.6
I THOUGHT THAT TWO HOURS WAS WAY TOO LONG FOR THIS MOVIE	-1.8
OF COURSE ITS TOO MUCH 	-0.666666666667
IT FELL LIKE I WAS WATCHING ONE OF THOSE ARMY OF ONE COMMERCIALS SOMETIMES	-1.0
I I GUESS UM BUT THE FUNNY THING IS UM I MEAN FUNNY THING IS DESPITE AS DESPITE EVERYTHING BAD ABOUT THIS MOVIE I ENDED UP HALF WAY LIKING IT	0.6
OF COURSE ITS GONNA BE MAKING THEM LOOK GOOD JUST FINE	0.6
AND I I ALWAYS THINK THATS HILARIOUS	1.2
BUT WHAT MADE THIS MOVIE REALLY FUN WAS SOME OF THE ADULT HUMOUR JABS	2.0
I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY COOL	2.4
THAT WAS A GREAT EFFECT	1.2
THERE WAS A LOT OF CHEAP CHILD HUMOUR	-0.8
WHICH EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO 	1.2
THIS MOVIE IS ADORABLE	2.2
THERE WERE SOME REALLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE	2.0
THIS MOVIE IS JUST TOO ADORABLE	2.4
THE VISUALS WERE GREAT	1.8
THE VOICE ACTING EXCELLENT	2.8
TOY STORY HAD ELEMENTS OF IT BUT THIS MOVIE PLAYED WITH 3D AND UM DIFFERENT WAYS TO COME AT YOU OUT OF THE SCREEN	2.2
THIS WAS PROBABLY THE BEST 3D MOVIE IVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME COZ IT ACTUALLY USED 3D	2.8
THE VOICE ACTING IN THIS WAS INCREDIBLE	2.6
SO I LIKED THAT A LOT	2.2

AND THERE WAS MAYBE ONE TIME WHEN I THOUGHT I ACTUALLY HEARD RUSSELL BRAND HIMSELF 	-0.25
I KEPT I WAS LISTENING BORED 	0.2
AS FOR 3D I SAY YES	1.0
BUT OTHERWISE I THOUGHT HE WAS EXCELLENT	1.8
AND SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THAT THERES A LOT OF CHEAP TRICKS 	0.5
THERES ONE SCENE IN THIS MOVIE THAT MAKES 3D ENTIRELY WORTH IT	2.4
I MEAN MY STOMACH WAS ALMOST GOING WOHU AS WE WENT DOWN THE BIG DROP	0.6
BUT THERES A ROLLER COASTER SCENE AND IF YOU ARE UM GET A LITTLE BIT MOTION SICK YOU MIGHT NOT WANNA SEE IT IN 3D BECAUSE YOULL FEEL LIKE YOURE ON THIS COASTER	0.6
AND YOU DONT EXACTLY KNOW WHATS GOING ON	-1.0
AND I THINK EARLY ON THE TWIST IS REVEALED	-0.6
AND YOU DONT EXACTLY KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON 	-0.8
I THINK IT TAKES PLACE SOMETIME UM ITS I DONT THINK ITS PRESENT DAY	0.0
BUT ITS UM ITS SOMEONE MODERN I WOULD SAY	0.4
ITS NOT ITS NOT LIKE A PERIOD PIECE OR ANYTHING	0.2
WATCH THIS FUCKING MOVIE	-0.5
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY SPLIT ABOUT THIS MOVIE	-0.4
AND UM PARTICULARLY THE MOVIES THAT I FEEL LIKE SHOULDVE GOTTEN NOMINATED BUT DIDNT AND NEVER LET ME GO IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THOSE MOVIES	1.6
IT WAS A PRETTY SLOW MOVIE FOR THE MOST PART	-1.8
THERES A CERTAIN DEADPAN NATURE TO IT	-0.8
BUT THERE ARE YOU KNOW THERERE CRITICS OF MOVIES THAT ARE SOMETIMES TOO THOUGHFUL IN A WAY AND I THINK THAT WOULD NEVER LET ME GO	-0.8
AND IT WAS IT WAS THOUGHFUL	1.0
UM IN A WAY A LOT OF THE THEMES IN NEVER LET ME GO WHICH WERE VERY PROFOUND AND DEEP 	1.6
A LOT OF CRITICS SAID THAT IT RELIED TOO MUCH ON THE AUDIENCE TO UM EXPLORE THE THEMES IN THE FILM AND YOU KNOW TIGHTLY SO I GUESS WHICH	-1.8
AND I THINK THAT THE MOVIE DID RELY ON YOU TO KIND OF FIGURE IT OUT AND KIND OF DEAL WITH THOSE IDEAS BY YOURSELF	0.0
THEY WERENT FULLY EXPLORED 	-1.2
THOSE THREE ARE SOME OF THE BEST YOUNG ACTORS OF TODAY	2.6
BUT REGARDLESS I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE	2.2
AND KEIRA KNIGHTLEY I MEAN EVERYBODY KNOWS HER FROM THE PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN 	-0.4
SHE AND EVERYTHING SHE DOES SHE HAS SO MUCH GRACE TO IT AND SO MUCH FLUIDITY	2.0
AND ANDREW GARFIELD OF COURSE EVERYBODY KNOWS HIM FORM THE SOCIAL NETWORK 	0.0
BUT I MEAN IN HER OTHER WORKS LIKE PRIDE AND PREJUDICE SHES JUST BEEN REALY FANTASTIC	2.6
BUT ANYWAYS THEY DID UM THEY DID ACT VERY WELL 	1.4
SO LOOK OUT FOR THAT THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING	1.2
AND CHILDREN WILL LIKE THE MOVIE	1.6
PARENTS WILL FIND THEMSELVES LAUGHING AS THEY REMINISCE THEY CHILDHOOD	1.6
SINCE THE SMURFS ARE SO ADORABLE AND THEY GO ON THRILLING ADVENTURES	2.0
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WOULD APPEAL MORE TO YOUNGER AUDIENCE	-0.2
I THINK THE MOVIE REALLY DEPICTED THE LIVELINESS OF NEW YORK CITY WHILE SINCE IM A NEW YORKER MYSELF	2.0
BUT I ACTUALLY FOUND MYSELF ENJOYING THE MOVIE AND LAUGHING 	1.8
THE MOVIE ALSO DELIVERS MANY MEANINGFUL MESSAGES	2.0
I ALSO LIKED HOW THE STORYLINE OF THE MOVIE WORKED TOGETHER SMOOTHLY	2.0
THEYRE SO HILARIOUS AND SIMILAR TO XXX PERSON WITH THAT	2.0
I ALSO THOUGHT SOME PARTS OF THE MOVIE WERE FUNNY FOR EXAMPLE UM GARGAMELS CAT FACIAL EXPRESSIONS	1.8
IT IS A FUN FAMILY FILM	1.8
I RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO CHILDREN SIX AND UP	2.2
I WAS KIND OF UPSET ABOUT THAT	-1.0
THERES A GIANT ASS TWIST TO THIS MOVIE AT THE END	1.6
LIKE ITS OBVIOSLY NOT LIKE A SERIOUS FUCKING MOVIE OR ANYTHING	-1.0
ITS COMEDY ROMANTIC ROMCOM RAOA	0.2
AND SHE DIDNT REALLY ACT LIKE ME AT ALL	-0.5
AND I WAS KIND OF UPSET ABOUT IT	-1.6
BECAUSE LIKE SHE MUSTVE BEEN AN ANIMAL AND SHE WASNT 	-0.5
AND I WAS THINKIN LIKE IF I CAN BE MOTHER FUCKING EMMA STONE AND CHRIS CAN BE ROYAN GOSLING AND THAT WOULD BE JUST GREAT DIDNT REALLY HAPPEN IN THE MOVIE	-1.4
IM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF FOR NOT REALISING THE TWIST BEFORE IT ACTUALLY TWISTED	-1.0
BECAUSE LIKE WHAT THE FUCK LIKE THATS WHAT IM GOOD AT	-1.25
OR WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO CALL RAYAN GOSLING LEATHER SHOE AND SUIT PORN	-0.8
SO THERES NOT GONNA BE ANY OF BAD SHIT	0.8
BUT I ACTUALLY REALLY FUCKING LOVE THIS MOVIE	2.8
I THINK THAT THAT THEY PERSONALLY THOUGHT THAT RACHEL WITHERS REALLY FUCKING LOVE SUITS AND RYAN GOSLING SO THEY MADE THIS MOVIE WITH ME IN MIND	0.8
SO ANYWAY THE MOVIE WAS REALLY FUCKING AWESOME	3.0
I WISH I WAS RYAN GOSLING	1.6
NO REALLY LIKE RACHEL WHITERS NEEDS SOME FUCKING FAT MATERIAL	-2.2
IM NOT GONNA FUCKING SPOIL ANYTHING FOR YOU JUST BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE RUDE	-1.2
RYAN GOSLING THE BEST PART IN THE MOVIE	1.0
BEST PART OF THE FUCKING ASS MOVIE WAS THIS ONE SCENE WHERE RYAN GOSLING WAS JUST STANDING THERE IN A FUCKING SUIT EATING PIZZA IN SLOW ASS MOTION	1.2
AND YOU SHOULD ALL GO OUT AND SEE IT AND YOU KNOW STUFF	1.6
EMMA STONE WAS IN THIS MOVIE AS WELL AND YOU WOULDNT REALLY KNOW IT COZ SHE WAS HARDLY IN IT	-1.6
THAT WAS JUST LIKE HU LIKE ZOOMING IN ON HIM AND IM JUST LIKE SITTING HERE LIKE ANY MOTHER FUCKERS DROP	-0.8
COZ YOU KNOW APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET AKA TUMBLER BECAUSE EVERYONE ON TUMBLER IS ON CRACK THEY ALL THINK I LOOK LIKE HER OR LIKE SOUND LIKE HER OR ACT LIKE HER 	-0.75
AND I WAS REALLY UPSET ABOUT IT 	-2.2
LIKE I KIND OF SOUND LIKE I MIGHT HAVE A PENIS	-0.5
I DONT KNOW I GUESS WE BOTH HAVE LIKE THAT LIKE MM MALE SOUNDING VOICE	0.0
WE BOTH LIKE FLOOGED IN SHIT 	-0.25

REALLY GOOD SOUNDTRACK	0.0
BUT IT WAS A REALY GOOD MOVIE	2.4
THESE TWO DEVELOPMENTS TOGETHER CAUSED WHAT WAS UP TO THAT POINT A NOBLE EFFORT TO START FALLING APART AT THE SEAMS	-1.6
AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO WATCH	-2.6
I DONT EVEN KNOW WHY I REALLY SHOULD BEGIN WITH LISTING OFF THE NEGATIVES BUT IM GOING TO START WITH A FEW OF THE SUPERFICIAL THINGS	-2.4
THE ACTING RANGES FROM MEDIOCRITY TO HAMFISTED FROM THE LIVE ACTION ACTORS	-1.6
AND UM I THOUGHT IT WORKED WORKED PRETTY WELL	1.6
UM AND IN FACT IN SPITE OF ALL THE NEGATIVES IM ABOUT TO MENTION I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS WORKING FOR A WHILE FOR ABOUT THE FIRST THIRD UM BUT AT THE END OF ACT ONE TWO SIGNIFICANT THINGS HAPPENED	-0.8
HACTOR HUMMAND ARRIVES AND STARTS CHEWING SCENERY LIKE ITS A TWO DOLLAR STEAK	-1.6
AND HOW JORDAN FLIES OFF TO THE GREEN LANTERN CORE PLANET OH AND THE MOVIE STARTS SEQUEL BAITING	-1.0
BUT I CANT REALLY BLAME THEM FOR THAT 	-0.2
THIS IS STAR WARS PREQUAL TERRITORY	-0.4
I CANT EXPRESS MY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE ADEQUATLY WITHOUT DESCRIBING SOME SPECIFIC THINGS IN THE THIRD ACT OF THE MOVIE	-0.75
AND PUT THEM IN A JUSTICE LEAGE MOVIE WITH THE RITUAL BATMAN AND SUPERMAN	0.25
IT WAS WIDELY BELIEVED THAT A SUCESS OF GREEN LANTERN MOVIE WOULD LEAD WARNER BROTHERS TO ADAPT THE FLASH AND WONDER WOMAN AMONG POSSIBLY OTHERS 	0.8
IT HAD TO DEAL WITH THE EXPECTATIONS OF POTENTIALLY SETTING UP ALL THAT OTHERS STUFF	-0.2
SO NOT ONLY THAT THIS MOVIE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BURDEN OF TELLING ITS OWN SELFCONTAINED STORY AND SETTING UP ITS OWN INEVITABLE SEQUELS	-0.4
TO ALL THE GREEN LANTERN FANS OUT THERE I AM SO SORRY	-2.0
YEAH NOT GOOD	-2.0
AND WARNER BROTHERS IS NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU ONE	-1.0
I SAY THAT FOR TWO REASONS FIRST BECAUSE SOMEONE OWES YOU AN APPOLOGIE 	-1.0
BEFORE I GET TO THE NEGATIVES OF THE MOVIE LET ME LIST OFF A FEW OF THE POSITIVES	0.4
AND SECONDLY BECAUSE AS A MARVELL GEEK I HAVE EXPERIENCED MY FAIR SHARE OF DISAPPOINTMENTS OVER THE LAST DECADE AND I CAN GENUINLY SYMPHATIZE WITH YOU	-0.75
THEY DO A GREAT JOB WITH THEIR ROLES	2.0
I LOVE JEFFREY RUSH AND MICHAEL CLARKE DUNCAN AS THE VOICE ACTORS	1.4
I ALSO LOVE THE CASTING OF MARK STRONG AS SINESTRO	2.0
THEY ARE GREAT ADDITIONS	1.6
AND UM FINALLY A PARTICULAR STAND OUT SCENE FOR ME WAS THE FIGHTER JET SEQUENCE	1.4
HES PERFECT FOR THAT ROLE	2.2
I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY WELL PUT TOGETHER	2.4
IT WAS BY FAR MY FAVORITE ACTION SEEN IN THE MOVIE	2.2
BUT STILL ITS THAT KIND OF MOVIE MAKING 	-0.4
THE ACTING IS NOT THAT BAD	-0.8
BUT UM YEAH GO CHECK IT OUT	1.4
ITS ONE ITS ONE TO CHECK OUT IN THEATERS I WOULD SAY	1.2
UM SNIF BUT YEAH SO THE GREEN HORNET IT WAS OK	1.0
I EXPECTED A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUSNESS	-1.0
YOULL HAVE FUN 	0.0

LOTS OF LOTS OF LAUGH OUT LOUD MOMENT I GUESS YOU COULD SAY 	1.6
BUT IT WAS STILL GOOD	1.2
IT GET IT GETS PRETTY SERIOUS 	0.2
AND IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD	2.0
HE WAS THE SAME OLD GOOFY SETH ROGAN THAT WE ALL KNOW	-0.2
UM I WAS EXPECTING SETH ROGAN TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS IN THIS MOVIE BUT HE WASNT	-1.0
UM I THINK THAT I MEAN I HAD FUN WITH IT	1.4
UM BUT IT WAS STILL A GOOD FILM	1.4
AND UM BECAUSE OF THAT I WAS EXPECTING SETH ROGAN TO MAYBE TRY TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS BUT HE WASNT	-0.8
SO TO ME THATS A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE	1.4
UM I STILL HAD FUN WITH IT	1.4
BUT YOU KNOW THATS OK I GUESS	0.4
AND ALL THE ACTION SCENES WERE GREAT 	2.0
UM THE CAR THE BLACK BEAUTY THAT WAS AMAZING ALL THE GUNS EVEN THE CAR OVER THERE THAT WAS REALLY SWEET	2.8

UM I WOULD DEFINATELLY RECOMMEND YOU GO SEE IT IN THEATERS	2.2
TOO PRETTY INTENSE AT THE END	1.0
AND UM FUN AT THE END 	1.2
HE IS PERFECT FROM START TO FINSIH	2.4
HARISSON FORD IS A LONG FOR THE RIDE AND HAVING A BLAST AS THE SECOND LEAD	1.0
AND THE CAST IS PRETTY WELL ROUNDED OUT WITH SUPPORDTING PERFORMANCE FROM GUYS LIKE SAM ROCKWELL AS THE DOC	1.6
THEYRE ALL PLAYING CLICHED STOCK WESTERN CHARACTERS	-0.4
AND THE SAME THING HAS MORE OR LESS HAPPENED HERE YEAH THATS RIGHT	-0.4
THE MOVIE CALLED COWBOYS AND ALIENS DANIEL CRAIG STEELS THE WHOLE DAMN SHOW	2.4
HES PLAYING A VARIATION OF THE ICONIC MAN WITH NO NAME CHARACTER THAT WAS MADE FAMOUS BY CLINT EASTWOOD 	0.5
AND NOW THAT IVE SEEN HIM IN THE ROLE I CANT IMAGINE ANY OTHER CURRENT ACTOR TRYING OT PULL IT OFF	1.4
BUT I REALLY DONT CARE THAT THE CHARACTERS ARE WALKING CLICHES WHEN THEY ARE THIS WELL DONE 	1.6
AND THE ACTORS DO SUCH A GOOD JOB OF CARRYING OF THEIR PARTICULAR ARCS	2.0
COWBOYS AND ALIENS METAPHORICALY SPEAKING IS LIKE ONE OF THOSE NFL TEAMS THAT HAS THE TALENT TO BE A SUPER BOWL CHAMPION BUT INSTEAD ENDS UP BEING A WILD CART TEAM THAT JUST GETS DISMISSED IN THE FIRST ROUND OF PLAYOFFS	-1.0
I MEAN IT WASNT A BAD YEAR	-0.4
YEAH JOB PRETTY WELL DONE	0.8
AND THAT DESCRIBES COWBOYS AND ALIENS PRETTY WELL	0.0
BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL LEFT ON THE TABLE	0.0
BECAUSE GIVEN ALL THE STRIKES THAT IT HAD GOING AGAINST BEFORE WONDER PRODUCTION IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MUCH WORSE	0.2
THOUGH I GUESS I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT IT TURNED OUT AS GOOD AS IT DID	1.4
BUT THIS PROBABLY HAD THE UNFORTUNATE SIDE EFFECT OF RAISING BAD EXPECTATIONS TO UNREASONABLE LEVELS	-1.2
FORTUNALLY SOME GOOD DECISIONS WERE MADE BEFORE THE CAMARA STARTED ROLLING	1.75
THE FINAL PRODUCT ULTIMATELY DOESNT LIVE UP TO THE HIGH ORDER OF THAT FIRST TRAILER	-1.6
WHEN I SAW THE FIRST TRAILER BACK IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR THIS MOVIE IMMEDIATELY SHOT UP NEAR THE TOP OF MY LIST OF MUST SEE MOVIES FOR 2011	2.4
BUT IF THATS ALL YOURE LOOKING FOR YOULL ACTUALLY MISS THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE	0.6
BUT ITS STILL A PRETTY ENJOYABLE RIDE IF YOU GO IN WANTING TO SEE A BUNCH OF COWBOYS BATTLE A BUNCH OF ALIENS YEAH YOULL PRETTY MUCH GET YOUR FILL	1.2
I MEAN YEAH HES A COMPETENT ACTION DIRECTOR	-0.6
JON FAVREAU IS PROBABLY NOT THE GUY THAT I WOULD HIRE IF I WAS LOOKING FOR A DIRECTOR FOR AN ACTION MOVIE	-1.6
BUT ITS ACTION ISNT PARTICULARY MEMORABLE	-1.6
HES ACTION SEQUENCES ARE CERTAINLY A LOT BETTER THAN THE INCOHERENT IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW SLOPE THAT WE SEE IN A TYPICAL MICHAEL BAY MOVIE	0.0
THE IRONMAN FILMS ARE FONDLY REMEMBERED MOSTLY FOR ROBERT DOWENY JR NOT THE ACTION	0.2
AND THE ACTION WASNT THE MOST MEMORABLE THING ABOUT ANY ON THOSE MOVIES	-1.4
SIX DIFFERENT PEOPLE GOT WRITING CREDIT FOR THIS MOVIE AND THE RESULTS ARE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT	-0.4
COWBOYS AND ALIENS PROBLEM IS THE SCREENPLAY	-2.0
THE WRITING ISNT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST	-1.6
THE STORYLINE ISNT THIS GOOD	-2.0
BUT IF YOU DONT EXPECT A LOT I THINK YOULL ENJOY IT	1.0
SNAP MOST OF THE CRITICS ARE RIGHT	-1.75
BUT IF YOU LOVED THE SERIES AND YOU ALSO LIKED XXX THE FIRST MOVIE THAN YOURE STILL GONNA HAVE FUN 	1.6
IT JUST REALLY HEH	-1.0
IF YOUR PET PEES CARRIE WORE THOSE HORRENDOUS HIDEOUS HATS THEY WERE NOT CATCHING THE BALL	-1.8
JUST GO IN WITH LOW EXPECTAIONS 	-1.2
A FEW TIMES I THOUGHT THAT WAS BUMPED WAY OVER THE TOP	-1.0
AND A FEW TIMES I DIDNT LIKE THE FASHION	-1.2
UM BUT YOU KNOW THE PREMISE IS OK 	0.4
AND THEY KIND OF LOOKED LIKE CLOWNS THE DESERT SCENE WAS ONE OF THEM	-1.2
THE MOVIE IS REALLY TOO LONG 	-0.8
AND THERE ARE A FEW NICE MOMENTS	1.0
ITS NOT EVEN NECESSARY FOR THE PLOT	-1.6
THEY SHOULDVE JUST CUT THE WEDDING IN THE BEGINNING	-1.4
BUT ALSO NOT NECESSARY	-1.0
I ALSO THOUGHT THAT DESERT RIDING THE CAMELS ALL TROUP STOPPED LOOKING LIKE CLOWNS	-0.2
AND UM IT WAS JUST FUN TO SEE YOUR OLD FRIENDS AGAIN	1.4
BUT I LOVE THE MOMENT WITH CHARLOTTE IN THE CLOSET BECAUSE WHO HASNT EXPERIENCED THAT	2.2
BUT DONT EXPECT MUCH 	-1.8
SO IF YOUR A FAN ID DO IT	0.8
AND ITS JUST LIKE OR WHY DO WE NEED THESE THINGS 	-1.4
IT DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE 	-1.6
BECAUSE WHEN THE OLD FLYNN FINDS THESE THINGS WHATEVER THEY ARE THEYRE SO WISE AND NAIVE KINDA LIKE NAVI NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT	0.8
CLUE WHICH IS THE PROGRAM THAT HE CREATED IN THE FIRST MOVIE KINDA PULLS A BUNNY IN THE BOILER MOMENT IN THE SENSE THAT HE TURNS INTO A CRAZY JEALOUS PSYCHO STALKER BITCH	0.0
BUT THEN SAM FLYNN MEETS HIS FATHER AND TRON BASICALLY TURNS INTO A STAR WARS PREQUEL AFTER THAT ONE	-1.4
DISCONNECTION THEN THAT HAPPENS AT THAT POINT	-0.8
THE WRITERS JUST PULL THIS OUT OF THEIR ASS	-2.2
AND THE WHOLE MOVIE BECOMES ABOUT THESE CRAZY I I ISOS 	-2.0
AND CLUE HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IDIOTIC VILLAINS EVER CAUSE WHAT IS A WHAT IS CLUE	-2.0
FOR SOME KIND OF FREAKY TELEPORTATION	0.0
IM A BIG FAN OF THE FIRST TRON	1.4
BECAUSE UM IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 1980S PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT COMPUTERS CAN DO EVERY EVERY ANYTHING 	0.4
UM I THOUGHT THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME TO HAVE A TRON SEQUEL	2.2
BECAUSE IT KINDA CONTROLS OUR LIVES SO IT WAS THE PERFECT TIME FOR A TRON SEQUEL	1.4
AND EVERYTHING AND NOW TECHNOLOGY ACTUALLY DOES ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING	0.25
LIP SMACKING BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE FIRST THIRD OF THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING	2.6
UNFORTUNATELY UM THE WRITERS AND I WERE NOT EXACTLY ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH	-1.8
BUT YOU KNOW THE PACING IS SO GOOD	2.0
ITS THE BEST SUMMER MOVIE IVE SEEN ALL YEAR	2.4
YOU HAVE LOTS OF UH REFERENCES TO THE FIRST MOVIE	0.2
IT GETS STRAIGHT INTO THE STORY	1.0
AND ONCE SAM FLYNN ENTERS THE GRID YOU KNOW THE SOUNDTRACK DRAWS YOU IN	1.4
YOU HAVE NEW CHARACTERS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A CONNECTION TO THE OLD ONES	0.666666666667
UH THEY DONT WASTE A LOT OF TIME ON EXPOSITION	-0.4
THE SPECIAL EFFECTS LOOK AMAZING	2.6
AND LET ME TELL YOU THE GAMES LOOK GREAT	2.4
BECAUSE THE MINUTE THE SOUNDPLANE ENTERS THE GRID HE IS PUT IN THE GAMES	0.25
UM THE CHO THE CHOREOGRAPHY OF THE FIGHTS THE SPECIAL EFFECTS I WAS SO HAPPY TO BE BACK IN THE GRID THAT I WASNT REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE STORY OR WHERE THE STORY WAS GOING	1.8
ALL THOSE ACTION SEQUENCES IN INVOLVING THE GAMES WERE GREAT TO WATCH	2.0
AND ITS LIKE YOURE A COMPUTER PROGRAM OKAY IF YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD USING REAL PEOPLE ITS THE WORST WAY YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO THAT INFILTRATE SOME COMPUTER SYSTEM SOMEWHERE AND DETONATE SOME NUKES OR SOMETHING 	-2.0
SHE DISPLAYS THE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS OF HER CHARACTER SO WELL	1.6
YOU ACTUALLY FEEL FOR HER CHARACTER	1.8
YOU KNOW SHES GOING THROUGH THE STRESS AND YOU FEEL SORRY FOR HER AND YOU WANNA HELP HER 	1.0
OLSO THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES IVE EVER SEEN OUT OF HERS	2.8
IVE NOT SEEN ONE BAD MOVIE THAT SHES BEEN INTO	1.6
TERIFFIC IN THAT	-1.0
BUT MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD I MUST SAY SHE IS A TERIFFIC AND BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED ACRESS	2.4
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIS WORK ON THE FIRST ONE	1.6
BUT THE SECOND ONE IT DIDNT IN SOME WAYS TAKE TO THE NEXT LEVEL	0.4
I THOUGHT THE FIRST ONE WAS CREATIVE AND INVENTIVE AND REALLY BROUGHT SOMETHING NEW TO THE CINEMA 	2.0
SO IT WAS JUST ABOUT EQUAL TO THE FIRST ONE	-0.2
BUT IN SOME WAYS THE FIRST ONE WAS BETTER 	-1.0
NOW UM BUT SOME OF THE BRUSH PLOT THAT YOU MEY THINK I HATED THIS MOVIE BUT YOURE WRONG ACTUALLY I DID	1.2
NOW UM BUT SOME OF THE BRUSH PLOT THAT YOU MEY THINK I HATED THIS MOVIE	-0.8
FIRST IM GONNA GET INTO THE ACTING WHICH WAS MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THE SECOND ONE	2.2
I REALLY LIKED IT	0.8
I DID LIKE THE SECOND ONE	0.6
THE SECOND ONE HAD WOODEN ACTING IN SOME PLACES IM SORRY	-1.8
BUT THE REST OF THE ACTORS WERE SO WOODEN	-1.4
BUT THERE MOST OF THE ACTORS WE SO WITTY EXEPTION MAY BE THE POLICE COP AND KIM KIMBERLY	0.4
I DONT KNOW THEY DO SEEM THEY NEED TO LEARN ACTING BETTER 	-1.2
THEY WERE JUST THEYRE JUST THEY JUST WHY ACTING WHAT THEYRE DOING ANYWAY	-1.8
ANYWAY MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD OH MY GOD SHE IS A TERIFFIC	2.0
ANYWAY THE FURTHER I WENT ACTING WAS MUCH MUCH BETTER IN THE SECOND ONE 	1.8
BUT SHE IS ALSO A TERIFFIC ACTRESS	2.2
SHES NICE LOOKING AS WELL	0.0
IT WAS PRETTY MUCH JUST AND EXCUSE TO PUT TRAPS IN THE MOVIE BECAUSE IT WAS LITERALLY COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT	-2.2
LIKE I SAID I LOVED THE HOFFMANS STORYLINE 	2.2
BUT THE END WAS REALLY YOU YOU KNOW	-1.0
BUT I THOUGHT THE BEST PART OF SAW 5 WAS THE STORYLINE LIKE IN GENERAL	1.8
THE ENDING WAS NOT YOU KNOW CRAZY SHOCKING OR ANYTHING LIKE USUAL	-0.8
IT WAS NOT A REAL HUGE SAW TWIST MOMENT	-0.6
BUT LUCKILY HOFFMANS STORY UM WAS A REALLY REALLY REALLY AWESOME 	2.8
AND UM IT TOTALLY MADE UP FOR THAT SO THATS OK	1.2
AND I GUESS THATS SORT OF TRUE	0.4
BECAUSE I SURE DIDNT SEE THE END COMING	0.0
SO YOU KNOW I GUESS IT BALANCES OUT	0.2
UM SO YOU KNOW THAT WAS A LITTLE SURPRISING I GUESS	0.4
THATS NOT TO SAY THAT THE ENDING WASNT GOOD BECAUSE IT REALLY WAS 	1.4
BUT ILL SMACK THEM IN THE FACE FOR THE OTHER IRRELEVANT PLOTLINE	-2.6
AND DONT KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY WERE THINKING	-2.2
BECAUSE IM STILL EXCITED ABOUT IT	1.8
OK ALL OF YOU KNEW THAT OBVIOUSLY	0.0
AS SOME OF YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE I WAS EXTREMLY EXCITED ABOUT SAW 5	2.0
AND EXCITED TO SEE IT 	1.6
SO I WAS YOU KNOW REALLY HYPED UP	1.8
NOT EXECTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING 	0.6
AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT WAS DEFINATELY BETTER THAN THE SAW 4	1.6
AND UM ITS JUST MADE ME REALLY REALLY EXCIDED FOR SAW 6	2.4
BUT IT WAS STILL REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD	2.2
SO CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WRITERS FOR THAT	2.0
AND IT FIT VERY WELL INTO THE SAW SERIES IN MY OPINION	1.8
AND THE OTHER ONE WAS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL	-1.8
ONE OF THEM WAS GREAT	1.0
AND THE IRRELEVANT PLOT WAS WITH FIVE RENDOM STRANGERS 	-1.2
THE GREAT PLOT WAS WITH HOFFMAN TYING UP ALL LOOSE ENDS AND STUFF	2.2
BUT I TOTALLY MISSED HOW IT TIED IT TO THE MOVIE AT ALL	-0.8
KIND OF LIKE IN SAW 2	0.0
SO THAT WAS REALLY BIZZARE AND I DIDNT CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS AT ALL	-2.6
AND IM PRETTY SURE THATS BECAUSE IT DIDNT TIE IN TO THE MOVIE AT ALL	-1.6
SO IT WAS JUST REALLY REALLY STRANGE	-0.8
BECAUSE THEY WERENT YOU KNOW INTRODUCED WELL REALLY	-1.2
WHICH IS STILL GOOD	1.4
BUT IT WAS NOT EXECTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING AND SE SERIOUSLY EVERYTHING LEADING UP TO THE END WAS BETTER THAN THE ENDING 	-1.0
BUT LIKE I SAID THE PLOT OF HOFFMAN AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS REALLY REALLY AWESOME 	2.6
AND IT DIDNT EVEN YOU KNOW TRY TO CLOSE IT AT ALL LIKE THE WIND ISNT GONNA BLOW IT OVER OR ANYTHING ITS JUST OPEN	-1.5
BUT MAN OH MAN IT REALLY LEFT THE DOOR OPEN	0.8
AND IT PRETTY MUCH JUST LEFT THE DOOR WIDE OPEN FOR SAW 6 	0.2
SAW 5 HAS LEFT LIKE NO CLOSURE AT ALL AT THE END OF THE MOVIE	-2.0
BECAUSE THE MOVIE IS GOOD	2.0
HAH SO EVERYONE LIKE EVERYONE IN CINEMA WAS KIND LIKE ME 	0.8
BECAUSE EVERYTIME THAT WAS LIKE A JUMP EVERYONE JUMPED	0.8
YOU COULD FEEL THE JUMP IN 	1.0
AND EVERYONE WAS LAUGHING AFTERWARDS	1.0

BECAUSE THAT ATMOSPHERE LIKE EVERYONE JUST SCREEAMS 	0.4
AND JUST AND ITS JUST ITS SO FUNNY	0.8
UM SOMETHING LIKE WHAT I DO LIKE IF I JUMP A LOT	1.75
I THINK THATS HOW THEY COPE WITH GETTING JUM LIKE SCARED AND JUMP AND STUFF	0.4

ITS KIND OF LIKE QUITE FAKE LIKE I JUST I COULDNT BELIEVE IT I WAS LIKE WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING	-2.25
BUT OVERALL I ENJOYED IT	1.6
WHOEVER WROTE THIS ISNT THE WRITER DEFINATELLY	-1.6
UM AND THE MOVIE WAS PRETTY SHORT	-0.6
THE THE WHOLE MOVIE I WAS YOU KNOW THINKING THIS ISN AS BAD AS IVE HEARD AND IT WASNT 	1.2
OTHER THAN THAT UM I THINK IT WAS AND OK MOVIE	0.8
AND THE DIALOGUE THREW ME OFF	-1.0
I DONT THINK ITS AS BAD AS YOU PROBABLY READ ON REVIEWS	0.2
DEFINATELLY A LITTLE BIT ABOVE AVERAGE	1.2
SO YEAH GO SEE IT	1.4
I MEAN IT STARTS OUT REALLY SLOW	-1.0
IT WAS A COOL MOVIE	1.4
BUT OVERALL UM GO SEE IT	0.8
UM I THOUGHT THEY CASTED KIND OF WELL	1.0
THE ACTING WAS ALLRIGHT	0.2
OH MY GOD THE WHOLE MOVIE HAD A REALLY DRY DIALOGUE	-1.6
BUT WHAT REALLY THREW ME OFF WAS THE DIALOGUE VERY CHEEZY DIALOGUE	-2.4
BUT I DONT THINK THE HUMOUR REDEEMED THE MOVIE FROM BEING SO BAD IN THE DIALOGUE DEPARTMENT	-1.8
THERE WERE A COUPLE FUNNY PARTS	0.4
UM IT HAS IT HAS A VERY PREDICTABLE STORY	-1.4
AND AGAIN IT DOES REALLY TUG AT THE HEART STRENGHTS WITH THE LITTLE BABY ANIMALS AT THE BEGINNING	1.4
BUT IF IT WAS ANNE HATHAWAY WHO DID THE SINGING SHE DID A GREAT JOB	2.4
THAT SO WHAT IS STILL A REALLY GREAT MOVIE TO TAKE YOUR WHOLE FAMILY TO	1.8

AND I HOPE THIS TAKES OVER AS THE NEW SYSTEM	1.0
BECAUSE ITS IT IS A GIMMICK ULTMATELLY	-1.6
UM BUT I WILL SAY UM WITH THIS WITH THIS QUALITY OF 3D YOU COULD ALMOST MAKE YOU KNOW A REGULAR LIKE A DRAMATIC MOVIE OR AN ACTION MOVIE OR SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY GOOD MOVIE AND YOU COULD MAKE IT 3D AND IT WOULDNT AT ALL 	1.4
BUT ITS ACTUALLY WORTH TALKING ABOUT	1.0
AND I ACTUALLY AM NOT FINDING THE SERIES TO BE VERY FUN AND POPCORN KIND OF MOVIE	0.0
BECAUSE THE MOVIE ITSELF IS THE SAME OLD CRAP FROM THE SERIES 	-2.0
IN THIS CASE IT DIDNT TAKE MUCH CONVINCING WHICH IS A LITTLE SILLY	0.0
YOU JUST CANT WALK IN EXOPECTING ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT	-0.6
THE PLOT IS YOU KNOW	-0.2
BUT THE ACTING IS BAD 	-2.2

AND I GET ANGRY ABOUT IT LAUGHTER XXX DOESNT PLAY BEST CHARACTER IN THE FILM 	-2.0
SECOND THERES ONE MASSIVE PLOT HOLE IN THIS FILM AND IT IS THE SIZE OF A DRAGON THAT IS BIG AS A MOUNTAIN AND WHEN YOU SEE THE FILM YOULL PROBABLY KNOW WHAT I MEAN	-1.0

AND THE ONLY EXPLANATION I COME UP WITH MAKES THIS STORY KIND OF KIND OF CREEPY	-1.0

OTHER THEN THOSE TWO THINGS THIS IS A REALLY FUN FILM THAT YOU WILL ENJOY UNLESS YOU ARE SOLELESS PIECE OF MACHENERY	-0.4
I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT 3D IS REALLY RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE	-1.2
YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR KIDS	1.6
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON	1.8
ITS PROBABLY THE BEST THING CURRENTLY IN THEATERS	2.2
AND IF YOU DONT HAVE KIDS YOU MAY WANNA CONSIDER SEEING IT ANYWAY	1.8
ITS A LOT OF FUN TO WATCH	2.2
IT IS ITS A GREAT STORY	2.6
AND ITS REALLY WELL WRITTEN	2.0
ITS BEAUTIFULLY DONE 	2.6
THEY REALLY NEEDED TO SOMEHOW SET THEM APART WITH ARMOR 	-1.6
YOU CANT TELL WHICH ARE THE GOOD OWLS WHICH ARE THE BED OWLS	-0.6
OR YOU CAN SEE UP TO YOU	0.2
ANYWAY THIS IS ONE YOU CAN SKIP	-1.8

THE FLYING SEQUENCES ARE BEAUTIFUL 	2.4
THE CGI WORK THE 3D IS SPECTACULAR	2.8
AND COME OF REAL 	0.2
AND THE OWLS ARE REALLY WONDERFUL	2.2
BUT THE STORY IS VERY DARK	-1.0
AND THEY DO HAVE VERY NICE PERSONALITES 	1.6
UM MY OTHER COMPLAINT OTHER THAN THAT THERES LIKE NOTHING LIGHT OR FUNNY IN THIS STORY TO BREAK UP THE SLUMBER MOOD IS THE BATTLE ITSELF	-1.8
IN FACT MY SIX YEARS OLD WAS SCARED MOST OF THE MOVIE	-1.8
UM BUT HEY IF YOURE LOOKING TO SPEND SOME MONEY UM GO CHECK IT OUT MAYBE YOU WILL LIKE IT	-1.0

THE FIRST ONE WAS A LOT BETTER 	-0.8

I THINK ITS REALLY MUCH MORE LIKE A MUSICAL 	0.6
UM AND AND ALL THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE BUT I DONT THINK ITS TRYING TO BE THAT	-0.6

NOW IM NOT GONNA LIE THERERE A FEW PARTS THAT HAVE GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES NOW EVEN THOUGH IT IS AN ANIMATED FILM IT DID HAVE SOME GREAT FIGHT SCENES	1.4
UM EVEN THE KIDS AND THE AUDIENCE ITSELF JUST KIND OF CHUCKLED A LITTLE BIT GAVE A FEW LAUGHS	-1.0
EVERYTHING YOU SEE IN THE TRAILER ITSELF WAS PRETTY MUCH ALL THE HUMOR YOURE GONNA SEE IN THE MOVIE	-1.6

ITS ITS A BIT OF A MIXED BAG COZ THERE WERE SOME VERY BRIGHT MOMENTS	0.8
BUT WHAT IT LACKS IN THOSE AREAS IT MOST DEFINATELY MAKES UP FOR JUST LIKE SHEER VISUAL SPECTACLE	1.8
BASICALLY A LOT OF ELEMENTS THAT I COULD TAKE A MOVIE ON ITS REALLY WOBBLY	-1.4
SO MANY MOMENTS IN THIS MOVIE THAT ARE JUST FRAMED AND LIT SO PERFECTLY THAT SO THAT YOU JUST GO LIKE KIND OF HUH THATS REALLY REALLY COOL	2.4
I MEAN THIS MOVIE HAS THE MOST GORGEOUS VISUALS OUT OF ANY MOVIES SINCE PROBABLY AVATAR ME IF NOT PRETTIER	2.6
IT IT DOESNT MAKE MUCH SENSE I KNOW	-1.2
AND THEN TAKE THAT WORLD THAT HAVE BEEN SET LIKE A CRAP TUNNEL OF REALLY KINETIC REALLY WELL DONE ACTION SEQUENCES IN IT AND YOU HAVE TRON LEGACY	2.2
AND BASICALLY THIS MAKES NO SENSE 	-1.8
MAIN DRAW FOR ME FOR THIS MOVIE WAS JUST THE FACT THAT ITS SET IN THIS LIKE RIDICULOUS WORLD WITH ALL THESE BRIGHT BEAUTIFUL COLORS AND RIDICULOUS ACTION SEQUENCES	0.4
BUT I DO THINK ITS A VERY INTERESTING ONE	1.2
AND I DONT THINK THATS A VERY GOOD MOVIE 	-1.6
BUT I WAS STILL RIDICILOUSLY ENTERTAINED BY IT	2.6
I CAN TELL YOU THAT TRON LEGACY IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE	-2.4
TRON LEGACY IS A MOVIE WHERE ON MOST COUNTS THAT I JUDGE MOVIES IT KIND OF FAILS	-1.0
ARE THESE TWO THINGS POSSIBLE IN THE SAME SENTANCEI I REALLY DO THINK SO	0.8
THE SCRIPT CAN BE HORRIBLE	-2.0
THE PERFORMANCES ARE NAH	-1.4
AND SOME REALLY COOL GUN FIGHTS	2.0
UM ONE OF THE BIG THINGS I WAS DISAPPOINTED THOUGH WAS I FELT THAT THEY COULDVE DONE A LOT MORE WITH 3D	-1.6
UM NOW I DONT REALLY RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU GO ON A DATE WITH SOME GIRL	-2.0
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST GONNA BE MORE THAN THAT BUT SO I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THAT	-1.8
UM BUT IF YOURE XXX MOVIE GOER LIKE I AM I TOTALLY RECOMMEND SEEING THIS BECAUSE ITS JUST A FUN ENTERTAINING MOVIE AND I THINK THAT YOU WILL ENJOYE IT	2.6
NOW THIS MOVIE IS JUST RIDICULOUS AND I I THOUGHT IT WAS EXCELLENT	3.0
SHE DIDNT REALLY DO ANYTHING FOR ME	-1.6
HER ACTING WAS PRETTY BAD	-2.0
AND HIS ACTING WASNT REALLY GOOD IN THAT MOVIE 	-1.6
BUT THE REAL STAR THAT FELL OUT OF THIS MOVIE WAS WILLIAM FICHTNER CHARACTER OR WILLIAM FICHTNER	1.4
AND WHATEVER SO NO IM NOT SAYING THIS MOVIE IS BAD COZ ITS ITS NOT	-0.8
BUT IT MADE IT HYSTERICAL AND IT WAS JUST FUNNY WITH ALL OF THESE LITTLE ONE LINERS THAT HE HAD	2.2
IT WAS IT WAS GOOD	1.8
LIKE I SAID BEFORE IT HAD TACKY ONE LINERS THAT WERE JUST HYSTERICAL	1.6
THE WHOLE TIME I SAW HER ALL I THOUGHT WAS HELEN HUNT AND RENEE ZELLWEGGER	-0.4
ANOTHER THING WAS THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NOT ONE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP OR POSITIVE GOOD RELATIONSHIP IN THIS WHOLE MOVIE	-2.0
BUT THATS KIND OF DEPRESSING 	-1.4
I DONT REALLY KNOW I DONT ITS SO WEIRD	-0.75
AND THERE WERE TIMES THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY	0.6
I THERE WERE TIMES IN THE MOVIE WHERE I FELT REALLY BORED	-1.8
I JUST DONT THINK IT WAS VERY GOOD	-2.2
AND THERE WERE TIMES THAT I WAS JUST SITTING THERE AFTER THEY SAID THEIR JOKES AND I WAS LIKE THATS NOT NOBODYS LAUGHING THATS NOT FUNNY	-2.2
SO I THINK THAT NO STRINGS ATTACHED WAS BETTER THAN FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS	0.8
AND THIS IS THE THING FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS AND NO STRINGS ATTACHED THEY ARE THE SAME MOVIE DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING TO THE SAME POINT BUT ITS THE SAME POINT	-0.6
I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY FUNNY 	2.0
I WAS NOT BORED DURING NO STRINGS ATTACHED	0.6
BUTSIGH IT HAD A LOT OF REALLY BAD MOMENTS	-1.4
UM AND UH FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS HAD ITS MOMENTS	0.0
HE IS BRILLIANT THERE IS NOT A MOVIE THAT I SEE HIM IN THAT I DONT END UP CRYING BECAUSE HE IS SO FANTASTIC AND HE JUST BREAKS YOUR HEART WHENEVER HE DOES YOU KNOW A ROLE THAT USUALLY HIS ROLES DO BREAK YOUR HEART AT SOME POINT SO DEFINITELY DID IN THIS MOVIE	2.8
AND HE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS EVER	2.0
THE LADY WHO PLAYS JUSTIN TIMBERLAKES SISTER UM I THOUGHT SHE WAS VERY GOOD IN THIS MOVIE	2.2
I LIKE TEARED UP IN FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS BECAUSE OF HIM	1.4
AND SHE LOOKS LIKE RENEE ZELLWEGGER AND HELEN HUNT FROM A TWISTER MOVIE	-0.2
AND I THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST LIKE REALLY NATURAL AND FUNNY	2.0
IT WAS WEIRD	-1.0
AND SHE TALKS LIKE HER TOO	0.2
LIP SMAKCING A LOT OF THIS MOVIE BRINGS A CUTE LAUGH HERE AND THERE	1.0
EVEN THOUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE IS BASED ON WHETHER SHE GETS TO DUBLIN IN TIME YOURE NEVER REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHE GETS THERE	-0.4
AND SEEM TO BE REALLY ENJOYING THEMSELVES THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH	1.8
AND BOTH THE ACTORS AMY ADAMS AND MATTHEW GOODE WORK WELL WITH EACH OTHER	1.4
ALL IN ALL IF YOURE LOOKING FOR A CUTE ROMANTIC COMEDY WITH A BEAUTIFUL SETTING THEN THIS WILL PROBABLY BE A GOOD MOVIE FOR YOU	2.0
EVEN WHEN THEYRE FIGHTING IN THE MOVIE THOUGH IT JUST SEEMS LIKE ITS THEIR BANTER NOT ACTUAL DISLIKE	-0.8
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER NAME FOR THE MOVIE	-0.2
THE COUNTRYSIDE WHICH THEY SHOWED WHILE GOING ACROSS IRELAND WAS ASTOUNDINGLY BLE BEAUTIFUL	2.0
AND I REALLY ENJOYED IT	2.2
ALTHOUGH I ENJOYED THE MOVIE	1.2
AND IN THE SCENE WITH THE DESTROYED CASTLE IT REALLY REMINDED ME WHY I WANT TO GO THERE SO BADLY	1.4
ITS A FUN CHICK FLICK 	1.6
IF I THINK ABOUT IT HONESTLY THE PLOT WASNT THAT GREAT	-1.2
LIP SMACKING ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT COME TO STOP THEM FROM GETTING TO THEIR DESTINATION ARE ALTHOUGH PLAUSIBLE A LITTLE WEAK	-0.8
BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT DOESNT REALLY HOLD UP UNDER INSPECTION	-1.6
SO ZACH SNYDER HERE IS MAKING A MOVIE THATS OSTENSIBLY ABOUT FEMALE EMPOW EMPOWERMENT BUT ITS A MOVIE ABOUT FEMALE EMPOWERMENT WHICH INCLUDES A LOT OF CLEARING THROAT SLAPPING THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF WOMEN IN BUSTIERS THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF VIOLENCE DONE AGAINST WOMEN AND ULTIMATELY IN WHICH MOST OF THE WOMEN END UP COMPLETELY DISEMPOWERED	-2.6
IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE IN FACT IT WOULD BE RACIST	-2.2
I COULD KINDA SEE THAT IN A SORT OF CHRIS ROCK DAVE CHAPELLE WAY	1.0
CLAPPING LAUGHING SO OKAY IF ZACH SNYDER WERE A WOMAN I WOULD SAY OKAY SHES MAKING A COMMENT ABOUT THE WAY WOMEN CANT BE EMPOWERED IN MALE DOMINATED SOCIETIES IN THE WAY MEN UM DISTRACT AND AND HURT AND DAMAGE WOMEN AND PREVENT THEM FROM ASSERTING WHO THEY REALLY ARE	-0.4
SO IF I GIVE ZACH SNYDER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT THIS IS A MOVIE THAT LOOKS GREAT HAS SOME BAD ACTING	0.4
BUT ZACH SNYDER IS A GUY AND BECAUSE OF THAT THIS STUFF KINDA ENDS UP LOOKING LIKE THE SH HE MAN WOMAN HATERS CLUB	-1.6
IF I DONT GIVE ZACH SNYDER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT 	-0.6
AND HAS WAY TOO MUCH VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN	-1.8
POOP	-2.5
GUARDIANS OF OWL LAND WHATEVER THAT CAME OUT AND I NEVER SAW IT	0.0
MUSIC IN BACKGROUND LAUGHING CURRENTLY IN THEATRES STARRING NO ONE YOUVE EVER HEARD OF	-0.6
UM HERES WHY YES STUTTERING T THERES PROBLEMS WITH THIS AND I WANNA TALK ABOUT THEM BUT YOU KNOW IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL	0.4
AND THIS SUCKERS GETTING THIS SUCKER IS GETTING PANNED LIKE LAST AIRBENDER GARBAGE PANNED AND I WANNA SAY THIS I DID NOT THINK IT WAS LIKE LAST AIRBENDER GARBAGE	-2.6
IT ACTUALLY HAS SOME SOME THEM THEMATICALLY IT HAS SOME COOL THEMES ABOUT HEROISM AND ABOUT LIKE TAKING OWNERSHIP OF YOURSELF AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH I RESONATED WITH AND I WHI AND WHICH I APPRECIATED	1.8
THERE ARE SOME REALLY COOL UH MOMENTS IN THIS	2.0
UM IF LIKE ME OR LAUGHING SOME OTHER WHITE PERSON OR HISPANIC PERSON OR WHATEVER DID THE SAME JOKES IT WOULD NOT BE FUNNY	-2.0
BUT HERES THE ESSENTIAL PROBLEM WITH THIS MOVIE THE ESSENTAIL PROBLEM OF THIS MOVIE WELL MAYBE THIS WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT UM THERE WAS A UH A COMEDIAN NAMED DAVE CHAPELLE UM AND DAVE CHAPELLE UM AND ANOTHER COMEDIAN CHRIS ROCK ARE UM AFRICAN AMERICAN AND IN THEIR COMEDY THEY SOMETIMES TAKE ON AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE WHAT THEY PERCEIVE TO BE AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE AND SO THEY WILL ESSENTIALLY MAKE FUN OF BLACK PEOPLE AND THE THING WITH DAVE CHAPELLE AND WITH CHRIS ROCK IS BECAUSE THEYRE BLACK THEY CAN KINDA DO THAT AND THERES SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THATS ACCEPTABLE	-1.6
AND IT WASNT WORTH IT IN MY OPINION TO GO SEE IT	-2.4
SO THAT JUST PISSED ME OFF MORE 	-2.4
AND I LOVED IT AND THIS ONE JUST WAS A FLAT OF DISAPPOINTMENTS	-2.2
BUT REALLY I COULDVE SHOULDVE JUST WALKED UP AND LEFT AT THAT MOMENT	-2.4
SO IM GONNA RATE THIS ONE TWO STARS	-1.8
BECAUSE THE MOVIE DID HAVE SOME POINTS WHEN I WAS LAUGHING	0.4
BUT VERY FEW	-0.8

AND HE WASNT EVEN THAT GREAT THIS TIME AROUND	-2.0
PLAIN AND SIMPLY IT WAS DULL FOR ME	-2.0
AND THERE WAS NOTHING NEW TO OFFER	-2.0
I HAVE TO AGREE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WAS NOT GREAT	-1.4
AND JUST THEY ARE WITH ALL THE OTHER SEQUELS THAT ARE COMING OUT AN THIS ONE	0.0
SO THE ADDITION OF THIS CHARACTER WAS PRETTY POINTLESS	-1.8
