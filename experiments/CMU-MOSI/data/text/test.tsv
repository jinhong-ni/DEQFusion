LIKE EVERY SINGLE SCENE WAS CGI	-0.6
AND THEIR PLACE IS A RUN OF THE MILL ANIMATED ACTION ADVENTURE PLOT WITH A FEW CHUCKLES TROWN IN	-0.6
AND ALSO THE CUTE WINGS TO POP CULTURE	1.0
IF AWARD FOR THE GREAT CHARACTERS OF SHREK IN HIS SUPPORTING CAST THEY ARE STILL VOICED BY THE ORIGINAL STARS MIKE MYERS EDDIE MURPHY CAMERON DIAZ AND ANTONIO BANDERAS THE FILM WOULD BE A REAL BUST	-1.2
IT SEEMS LIKE THE WRITERS AND CREATORS TOOK THE EASY WAY OUT	-1.6

NOT A BAD IDEA FOR A SEQUEL	0.8
GONE ARE THE WICKEDLY SATIRICAL STAND UPS OF THE WORLD OF FAIRY TALES	-0.8
SHREK 4 MISSES OUT ON THE MAGIC THAT MADE THE FIRST FILM A REAL JOY TO VIEW	0.6
LIKE LIKE EVEN THE ACTORS WERE JUST LIKE YOU KNOW ITS A MOVIE ABOUT A FUCKING TOY	-1.6

THERE WAS PARTS THIS IVE SEEN SOME CREATIVE DEPTHS IN THIS MOVIE IVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE	1.4
UM SO CHANNING TATUM AND MARLON ARE TRANSPORTING IT THEY GET AMBUSHED BY UM I THINK ITS COBRA ITS KINDA HARD TO EXPLAIN IT	0.4
UM FROM THERE IT JUST GOES INTO RIDICULOUSNESS 	-1.6
CUZ ITS LIKE THE DUDE THAT MADE THE TECHNOLOGIES I I CANT RUIN THE MOVIE 	1.2
I WAS LIKE YOU KNOW THEYRE BOTH HASBRO TOYS THEYRE BOTH MOVES THAT ARE COM MADE FOR CHILDREN	0.0
THE THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS LIKE I I I WANNA COMPARE IT TO TRANSFORMERS 2 AND I ACTUALLY DID 	0.8
BUT THE THING ABOUT GI JOE COMPARED TO TRANSFORMERS IS TRANSFOMERS 2 DIDNT KNOW WHAT IT WANTED TO DO	-1.2
BUT THEY HAVE A LOT OF ADULT SITUATIONS IN IT	0.4
AS FOR GI JOE WAS IT WAS JUST LIKE LAUGHING ITS THE THE PLOT THE THE ACTING IS TERRIBLE 	-2.8
LIKE IN SOME PARTS YOU HAD PEOPLE GETTING KILLED AND THE NEXT PART YOU HAD FART JOKES AND STUPID FRAT HUMOR AND ALL THAT OTHER CRAP	-1.0
BUT ITS ITS LIKE SOMEONE MADE YOU A KICK ASS SANDWICH BUT THEY PUT MAYONNAISE ON IT AND YOU DONT LIKE MAYONNAISE AND ITS NOT LIKE TOMATO OR LETTUCE WHERE YOU CAN PICK IT OFF NO ITS GOT IT MAYONNAISE IN ITS ALL OVER EVERYTHING AND NOW YOURE STUCK WITH THIS KICK ASS SANDWICH THAT WOULD BE KICK ASS IF IT DIDNT HAVE MAYONNAISE ON IT BUT IT HAS MAYONNAISE ON IT OR YOU GO MAKE ANOTHER SANDWICH GO MAKE ANOTHER SANDWICH	-2.6
THIS MOVIE IS JUST NOT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH	-1.4
I REALLY LIKED DAVID FINCH	1.4
I LIKED ALL THE UM I LIKE THE CAST	1.6
BUT DONT GET ME WRONG ITS NOT ALL BAD	-0.4
ITS GOT MY TWO FAVORITE ACRESSES IN IT TILDA SWINTON AND CATE BLANCHETT	2.0
LIKE I SAID BEFORE IS A VERY INTERESTING IDEA	1.4
AND THEY DID A LOT OF GOOD THINGS WITH IT	1.6
BUT AND ITS A GOOD STORY	1.2
BUT CLAP HUH ITS A PASS	-2.0
WHAT WHATEVER THE NAME IS TOO LONG	-1.2
AND ITS THEY LOOKED LIKE IT HAD A GOOD CORE	0.6
ITS A VERY INTERESTING IDEA	1.25
THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT ITS ALL TOLD IN FLASHBACK FROM A POINT JUST BEFORE KATRINA HITS NEW ORLEANS	-1.8
BUT HM IT JUST TOO MANY PROBLEMS WITH IT	-2.4
I DONT NEED IT ALL TOLD IN FLASHBACK	-1.2
I DIDNT NEED ANY OF THAT CRAP	-2.6
IT DOSENT IT JUST ITS TOO MUCH CRAP IN HERE	-2.2
I DONT NEED THE ADDED ELEMENT OF KATRINA	-1.8
THEY JUST NEED TO CUT THAT OUT	-0.8
THE THE MOVIES IS TOO LONG 	-2.0
TH WE DO NOT NEED THE ENTIRE SPAN BIRTH TO DEATH 	-1.6
ANOTHER THING IS WE DONT NEED HIS ENTIRE LIFE	-1.8
AND SCALE IT DOWN ON LIKE TWO HOURS	-1.2
JUST GIVE ME A NICE INTERESTING CHOKE	1.2
UM AND IF YOURE GONNA DO MOSTLY CGI JUST MAKE AN ANIMATED MOVIE	-2.0
THIS ALSO FALLS IN TO THE TRANDY IS VERY POPULAR THESE DAYS IF YOU DO A WHOLE ALL OF CGI 	-1.0
MAKES HIM LOOK TOO TOO GOOD	-0.6
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT JUST HAS A POLYURETHANE COATING ON IT 	-1.0
MY NEIGHBOR PROBABLY THINKS IM CRAZY YELLING ABOUT MOVIES TO A CAMERA 	-1.0
NOW I DIDNT REALLY LIKE THE FIRST HOUR THAT MUCH THOUGH	-0.4
BUT I THINK THIS ONE DID BEAT SCREAM 2	1.2
I THINK XXX I WANT TO SEE IT	1.6
IM SURE YOU ALL REMEMBER THE STAB MOVIES THAT WERE BASED ON THE SCREAM MOVIES OR THE EXPERIENCES OF SIDNEY IN UNIVERSE SO THAT PEOPLE COULD COMMENT ON THE KILLERS REENACTING THE MOVIES OR FOLLOWING UP THE MOVIES WELL IN THE FIRST HOUR THOSE BECOME WAY WAY WAY TOO MUCH OF A PLOT POINT BASICALLY	-0.8
IM JUST KINDA LIKE NO THIS IS GOING TO FAR	-1.0
BUT IT ACTUALLY BASICALLY MAKES THE CHARACTERS CONGITION NOT JUST OF THE GENRE WITHIN WHICH THEY ARE IN BUT OF THEIR OWN FRANCHISE TO A RIDICULOUS EXTENT	-1.0
SO YOU BETTER APPRECIATE THIS REVIEW	0.25
THEYRE BACK TO YOU HAVING TWO KILLERS THANKFULLY	0.8
BUT TO ANY OF YOU WHO ARE I EXPECT A THUMBS UP	1.4
HMPH MY OVERALL OPINION OF THE RESULTS OF THIS PROCESS ARE ITS BETTER THAN SCREAM 3	1.2
BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE HAVING THE KILLER BE ABLE TO BE EVERYWHERE IF THERES TWO OF THEM	0.5
A LOT OF PEOPLE DONT LIKE SCREAM 2	0.0
AND ACTUALLY IS BETTER THAN SCREAM 2	1.6
I HATED SCREAM 3	-2.4
I THINK ITS HIGHLY UNDERRATED	0.8
AND LATER TIME SHE GOES LIKE A WORLD WAR II BATTLEFIELD UM CASTLE THIS KIND OF PULLED OUT OF LORD OF THE RINGS	-0.2
IN FACT THE FIRST TIME SHE GOES IN IT LOOKS LIKE A JAPANESE TEMPLE	0.0
ITS KIND OF PLAYING WITH THE IDEA WHATS REAL WHATS NOT WHAT THE MATRIX FILMS DID	0.2
WHATS IN HER MIND WITHIN HER MIND IN A WAY ITS KIND OF LIKE INCEPTION IN THAT WAY	0.0
ALTHOUGH ACTUALLY THE BEST COMPARISON THIS IS THIS FILM WOULD ACTUALLY BE SOMETHING LIKE PANS LABYRINTH 	0.0
IT ONLY HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE A FILM THAT WAS BOTH PROVKING AND ACTION PACKED	-0.4
THAT I GOT VERY LITTLE JOY OUT OF	-2.2
BUT UNFORTUNATELY ITS JUST AN UGLY WILD VIOLENT UNVOLVING AND SADISTIC EXERCISE	-2.8
THATS PRETTY HEAVILY INFERRED IN THE OPENING SEQUENCE 	0.0
IN FACT I GOT MOSTLY PAIN OUT OF IT	-2.8
NOW IT ALSO TAKES SO REALLY CREEPY XXXOF THE FACT THAT EMILY BROWNING IN THIS MOVIE LOOKS LIKE SHES UNDERAGE	-1.0
WHEN SHE GETS THERE IS FORCED TO NOT ONLY BE TRAPPED IN THE VOCATION THAT SHE OBVIOUSLY DOESNT WANNA BE IN	-0.2
THAT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE VIDEO GAME IN A CERTAIN WAY	-0.4
BUT I DONT KNOW	-0.5
SO I WILL GIVE IT POINTS FOR NOT BEING EXACTLY LIKE MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING EVEN AT THE TRAILER SETS IT UP THAT WAY	1.0
AND WE SECOND GUESS OURSELVES	0.0
BUT I DONT THINK SHES LEADING MATERIAL	-2.0
GINNIFER GOODWIN IS FUN TO WATCH 	1.8
IF THERE IS ANY SILVERLINING IN THIS MOVIE ITS JOHN KRASINSKI	0.6
AND LIKE I SAID KATE HUDSON COULDNT BE MORE ANNOYING HERE	-1.2
BUT HE HAS SOME OF THE FUNNIEST SCENES IN THIS MOVIE	1.6
WHO I DONT USUALLY LIKE	0.0
HE SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY REALISTIC CHARACTER HERE	-1.0
ITS ONE OF THOSE ROMANTIC COMEDIES THAT WE ALL DREAD	-2.6
ANNOYINGLY SHE KIND OF YELLS AND SCREAMS THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE	-1.25
NOW THE REAL STAR OF SOMETHING BORROWED IS GINNIFER GOODWIN	1.2
UM IT KIND OF FOLLOWS THE PATH OF MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING 1997 JULIA ROBERTS MOVIE EXCEPT IT TAKES THIRTY MINUTES LONGER TO DEVIATE FROM THE SCRIPTS OF MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING	-0.4
AND IF YOU CAN TOLERATE HER THE REST OF THE MOVIE ISNT ANY BATTER	-2.0
BUT MOSTLY ITS JUST KATE HUDSON BEING VERY ANNOYING	-1.6
THERE ARE SOME FUNNY MOMENTS	0.2
I THINK WITH WITH THESE KIND OF MOVIES WE KIND OF PREDICT	0.4
AND I THINK ITS PREDICTABLE UP AN TO A POINT	-1.0
BUT I KINDA WOULD HAVE READ THAT BEEN LIKE HM I MEAN SCHWARZANEGGER NEVER SAID ANYTHING REALLY THAT BADASS IN HIS MOVIES	-1.0
BUT ARITE AND MOVING ON THERES NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IN THIS MOVIE NONE	-2.0
WELL I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW I DONT REMEMBER THE NAMES OF ANY CHARACTERS NONE OF THEM WERE MEMBORABLE 	-2.0
AND THEY WERE ALL JUST REALLY BLAND AND FORGETTABLE	-2.0
EVERYTHING THEY SAY JUST SOUNDS SO FUCKING STUPID	-2.2
THE ONLY ACTOR WHO CAN REALLY SELL THEIR LINES IS ERIN ECKART	-1.0
THERE ARE MOMENTS WHERE HE SAYS SOMETHING YOURE LIKE THAT JUST SOUNDED DUMB AS HELL	-2.4
BUT HE TOTALLY SELLS IT	1.2
THE ACTION IS FUCKING AWESOME	2.8
ITS VERY REMINSCENT OF DISTRICT	0.0
THE ACTION IS REALLY REALLY WELL DIRECTED	2.6
BUT IT DIDNT TURN OUT QUITE NEARLY AS AWESOME AS THAT MOVIE DID	-1.2
9 ITS LIKE SOMEONE WATCHED THE THIRD ACT OF DISTRICT 9 A BUNCH OF TIMES LIKE LETS MAKE THIS INTO AN ENTIRE MOVIE ITLL BE AWESOME AND THATS PRETTY MUCH WHAT THEY DID HERE	-1.6
I DIDNT REALLY SEE A COMPARISON TO BLACK HAWK DOWN UNTIL LIKE THE VERY VERY END	-0.6
IN FACT THIS MOVIE ISNT EVEN ON THE SAME LEVEL AS DISTRICT 9 NOR IS IT UM FOR UH BLACK HAWK DOWN WHICH PEOPLE ARE COMPARING IT TO	-1.6
THE ALIENS ARE REALLY AWESOME	2.8
BUT NEVERTHELESS ANOTHER REALLY COOL THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE	1.8
AND THEY HAVE REALLY COOL TECHNOLOGY THATS REALLY INTERESTING TO WATCH LIKE MAKE THEM BLOW UP SHIT AND YOU KNOW 	2.4
THEY DESIGNED THE ALIENS IN A REALLY COOL UNIQUE WAY TO MAKE THEM LIKE BIOTIC BUT ALSO MECHANICAL	2.4
BUT ITS NOT ALWAYS QUITE EXPLAINED YOU KNOW LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ALIENS	-0.6
AND THEY ALWAYS LIKE PULL OUT SOMETHING NEW 	0.5
LIKE ENOUGH THAT IT ACTUALLY IS A GOOD REASON WHY THEY WHY THEYRE ATTACKING	1.33333333333
BUT THEY GIVE YOU A GOOD AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THEM	0.8
UH THE DIALOGUE IS TERRIBLE	-2.8
AND IT KEEPS YOUR INTERESTS IN THE ACTION SCENES AT LEAST DURING THIS MOVIE	1.2
NOTHING IN THIS MOVIE IS CLEVERLY WRITTEN	2.2
THERE IS NO GOOD DIALOGUE	-2.4
BUT IT DOES HAVE SOME ADULT HUMOUR	0.6
THOSE ARE QUOTE IN THIS MOVIE THAT SOUNDED SO DIRTY COMING OUT 	-0.2
BUT IT AS GREAT	2.0
YES UM SOMETHING ABOUT WAFFLE HOLE AM I THE ONLY ONE AM I PERVERTED NOT TO THINK THAT THAT SOUNDS DIRTY COZ IT TOTALLY DOES WAFFLE HOLE	-0.8

UM I I DID ENJOY IT	0.5
I DID LIKE THE FOURTH ONE QUITE A BIT	2.0
AND IT JUST WAS BETTER	0.6
IT REMINDED ME OF THE FIRST ONE HAD THE SAME KIND OF VIBE LIKE THE FIRST ONE	0.2
COZ THE FIRST TWO WERE GREAT AND THEY BROUGHT IN THE KIDS AND IT MADE IT MORE KIDDY FRIENDLY MOVIE	-0.8
MAYBE ITS THE BABY OGRES MAYBE BRINGING IN THE BABY OGRES REALLY BROUGHT IT DOWN	-1.8
BUT THEY WERE HAD ADULT HUMOUR 	0.8
THE FIRST TWO WERE KID MOVIES	0.25
AND WOULD GO OVER THE KIDS HEADS AND THIS IS WHAT THE FOURTH ONE KIND OF HAS	-0.6
I THOUGH THAT ADULTS WOULD APPRECIATE 	0.4
BECAUSE MY ONE OF MY COUSINS DOESNT LIKE THE GLASSES 	-1.0
UM YEAH ITS ITS BETTER THAN THE THIRD ONE ABSOLUTELY	1.6
LIKE I DONT UNDERSTAND 	-1.4
LIKE I I ACTUALLY FELT MYSELF CHECKING THE TIME CUZ I WAS LIKE WHEN IS THIS MOVIE GOING TO END	-2.4

MY 8 YEAR OLD WAS TERRIFIED THROUGH PART OF THIS BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL VERSION IS TERRIFYING	-1.0
SO LAUGHING IF THATS YOUR FORM OF CHRISTIANITY ITS A CHRISTIAN FILM	-0.2
CAUSE THIS IS A FILM THAT BASICALLY SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE OF POOR PEOPLE BECAUSE JESUS TOLD US TO TAKE CARE OF POOR PEOPLE AND IF YOU DONT TAKE CARE OF POOR PEOPLE YOURE GONNA BURN IN HELL	-1.2
UM ANOTHER THING ABOUT THIS FILM IS IN ITS DEVOTION IS THAT SOMETIMES MY CHILDREN COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS BEING SAID BECAUSE THEY WERE SPEAKING DICKENSONIAN ENGLISH	-1.0
UM ITS NOT MY FORM 	-1.5
THEREFORE A LOT OF SOCIAL COMMENTARY GOES WOOP SOUND EFFECT OVER YOUR HEAD	-1.4
SOMETIMES I MISSED WHAT WAS BEING SAID	-0.6
UM ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT DEBTORS PRISON FOR INSTANCE DOESNT REALLY UM JIVE HERE IN 21ST CENTURY AMERICA	-1.8
OR JUST REALLY DOESNT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO US TODAY AT ALL	-0.666666666667
BECAUSE THIS THING IS IS MEANT TO BE SEEN IN 3D	0.6
AND THIS FILM IS THIS AMAZING LIKE I SAY SLAVISH DEVOTION TO CHARLES DICKENS WITH AN AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE	2.2
