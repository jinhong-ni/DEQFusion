LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE IT STARTS WITH REALLY GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES	1.8
ITS IT WAS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE MOVIE	0.8
AND THE ENDING WAS REALLY REALLY GREAT TOO	2.6
I MEAN THE BLOOD IS LIKE TWILIGHT WITH SOME SCIFI WITH SOME ACTION AND WITH LIKABLE CHARACTERS AND THAT THAT IS IMPORTANT GUYS	1.6
THE MAIN PROBLEM OF THIS MOVIE IS THAT THIS MOVIE IS SO CHEESY 	-2.0
NOT LIKE THE CHARACTERS OF OF TWILIGHT	0.0
THE CHARACTERS OF I AM NUMBER FOUR ARE LIKABLE	2.0
THE LIKABLE CHARACTERS MAKE THIS MOVIE A REALLY GOOD MOVIE	1.4

BUT THEY TOOK A NEW SPIN ON IT	1.4
AND I JUST LOVED IT	2.6
AND I FEEL LIKE EVEN THOUGH THE FIGHTING SEQUENCES WERE A LITTLE BIT LONG IN SOME PLACES T	-0.6
SO I MEANT IF I WAS WEARING 3D GLASSES AND WAS SEEING THIS IN 3D I WOULDVE ENJOYED IT A LOT MORE 	-0.4
AND JUST DIFFERENT 	0.2
IT ENGAGES THE AUDIENCE MORE	1.8
AND I JUST REALLY ENJOYED IT	2.0
THE GREEN HORNET DID SOMETHING SIMILAR	0.0

AND HE FUNNIED UP THIS MOVIE BIG TIME TOTALLY	2.6
I FEEL LIKE IF THEY WOUDLNT HAVE INSERTED THE HUMOR INTO THIS MOVIE IT WOULDVE BEEN JUST TOO SERIOUS AND KIND OF BORING IN A SENSE 	0.4
AND THE HUMOR IT WAS KIND OF NECESSARY	1.0
AND THE ACTION SEQUENCES IN THIS MOVIE ARE TENSED	2.6
BUT THE HUMOR REALLY JUST NAILED IT	2.6
WHEN THEY JUST COME UP WITH THESE TOTALLY COMPLETELY NEW STYLIZED WAYS OF DEVELOPING ACTION SEQUENCES	1.6
I LOVE WHEN PEOPLE DO THIS	2.2
BUT WHEN THEY FIGURE OUT A NEW WAY TO INTERPRET THIS 	-0.25
COZ SURE ITS FUN TO SEE A SUPER HERO GO ROUND AND KICK BAD GUY BUTT YOU KNOW PUNCH KICK WHATEVER BAM 	0.8
THAT MAKES IT MORE VISUALLY TRULY APPEALING	1.4
AND ADD SOMETHING LIKE AN EXTRA SPARK IN THERE	0.8
THE ACTING COULD BE BETTER AND IS VERY MEDIO	-1.2
THERE IS SOME SORT OF GREATNESS TO SUCKER PUNCH THOUGH	1.6
FIRST THE VISUAL EFFECTS HERE ARE STELLAR	2.6
THEY ARE UNIQUE	2.8
BUT THEY YOU KNOW THEY THEY BRING NOTHING TO THIS TABLE 	-2.4
AND WHICH HURTS THE FILM DRASTICALLY	-2.2
BECAUSE THEY ARE INTERESTING CHARACTERS 	2.0

INCREDIBLE ICANDY	1.0
AND JUST OVERALL SUPERB	2.6
BROWNING IS MEDIOCRE ROLE	-2.2
SHE ISNT TERRIBLE	-0.6
THERES NEVER A FEELING OF STAR QUALITY WITH HER	-1.2
LIKE THE AVERAGE HORROR FILM THE UNINVITED 	0.0
BUT QUITE FRANKLY SHE IS IMPLAUSIBLE	-1.6
AND I DONT KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE HATING ON THE FILM BECAUSE I REALLY DO LOVE IT	2.2
AND VISUALLY STUNNING 	2.8
AND IS UPSTAGED BY MANY OTHER PERFORMANCES IN THE FILM	-0.2
OVERALL BROWNING IS JUST FAILS TO DELIVER	-2.4

AND THE ACTION IN THE MOVIE IS SO WELL USED	2.8
NOW LET JUST GET INTO TWO THINGS THAT WILL POSSIBLY ATTRACT YOU TO THIS FILM THE VIOLENCE AND THE 3D	0.4
ITS A JOKE REALLY	-2.4
THE VIOLENCE HERE IS PRETTY BAD	-2.0
VIEWERS PLEASE RESIST FROM THESE TWO	-1.5
THE TIRE DECAPITATION MIGHT NOT SOUND ALL THAT UNIQUE 	0.0
THERERE ABOUT TWO CREATIVE SCENES IN HERE UM ONE BEING IN INTESTINAL JOURNEY THROUGH THE RECTUM IN A SWIMMING POOL DRAIN AND A TIRE DECAPITATION THAT	-0.4
I MEAN NOT THE SICK LIKE OH MY GOD THAT WAS AWESOME 	1.0
BUT THE WAY ITS PULLED OFF ITS LIKE WOW THAT WAS SICK	2.2
THERES MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OF SAYING SICK NOWADAYS	-0.25
NO SICK IN THE OH MY GOD THAT WAS CRAZY THAT KIND OF SICK	-0.8

ITS BAD	-3.0
IM NOT EVEN GONNA GO TO THE LOWS TO MAKE A WHOLE NIGHT VIDEO ABOUT THIS MOVIE	-1.2
OH GOD THIS IS BAD	-3.0
I HATE IT	-2.8
SO NO NOW KNOW THIS I AM NOT A FAN OF THE FINAL DESTINATION SERIES	-2.4
BUT AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED THIS SERIES IS GARBAGE	-2.6
I MIGHT HAVE TO WATCH THE FIRST TWO AGAIN OR MAYBE JUST THE FIRST ONE TO STABILIZE MY THOUGHTS ON THE SERIES 	0.0
NOW I WONT EVEN TALK ABOUT ACTING COZ ITS JUST SO BAD	-2.8
YOU CAN SENSE MY EXCITEMENT WHEN I HEARD THIS WAS BEING RELEASED	-0.5
THE RACE STADIUM SCENE AND THE MALL SCENES IN THE BEGINNING AND THE END WHERE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF PEOPLE DIE IN THE CRAZIEST WAYS ARE PRETTY GOOD FOR LATE NIGHT BUDDY VIEWING YOU SEE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY LATE NIGHT BUDDY VIEWINGS	2.2
SO IT WAS JUST A LITTLE AWKWARD	-1.0
SO IT WAS JUST A LITTLE AWKWARD	-0.6
BUT UM WEVE OVERCOME THAT	1.0
YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE EXPENDABLES EVEN THOUGH IT CAME OUT SUCH A LONG TIME AGAO	0.0
MY BOYFRIEND GOT REALLY EXCITED WHEN I TOLD HIM WE WERE GONNA GO SEE THE EXPANDABLES	2.0
AND THAN UM WHEN I WENT TO BLOCKBUSTER AND I PICKED IT UP AND I BROUGHT IT BACK HOME HE GOT REALLY DISAPPOINTED	-1.0
I THINK ITS BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A MOVING FILM 	2.0
AND I DONT THINK HE KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE HIS EMOTIONS IN THAT DEPARTMENT	-1.0
THERES BEEN A LOT OF BUZZ ABOUT IT LATELY AND EVERYONES YOU KNOW A LOT OF CONTROVERSY OVER IT	-0.4
EVERYONES BEEN SAYING ITS REALLY INTENSE	0.4
AND I WAS UNBELIEVABLY SHOCKED HOW MUCH I LOVED IT	3.0
GREAT DIALOGUE 	2.0
IT WAS FULL OF ACTION	1.6
ITS REALLY JUST A HEART WARMING STORY	1.4
THE CHARACTERS WERE SO GREAT AND WELL DEVELOPED	2.4
ITS NOT THAT VIOLENT	-0.2
ITS A GREAT MOVIE TO SEE OVER AND OVER AGAIN YOUR WHOLE FAMILY CAN SEE IT	2.4
I REALLY REALY FELT FOR THE DAD IN THE EXPENDABLES 	1.0
XXX IT IS A TEENYTINY BIT VIOLENT AND NOT ENOUGH SO YOU CAN BRING YOUR 5 YEAR OLD 	0.0
THE DAD WAS JUST REALLY PROTECTIVE	1.8
BECAUSE HE WAS PROTECTING OVER HIS FAMILY AND AFTER THEY WENT MISSING EVEN THOUGH THEYRE A BEND OF OUTSIDERS AND THAY HAVE ALL THOSE POWERS	1.2
VERY HEART WARMING 	2.2
AND HE MADE SURE THAT HES WHOLE FAMILY WAS SAFE	1.4
BRAD BIRD IS A GREAT WRITER AND DIRECTOR 	2.6
VERY TOUCHING	2.0
IT WAS SO CUTE	2.4
UM I THINK THAT MY FAVORITE PART OF THE ENTIRE MOVIE WAS WHEN YOU FIND OUT AT THE END THAT THE LITTLE BABY HAD POWERS	2.2
I REALLY RECOMMEND YOU ALL SEE THE EXPENDABLES	2.4
JUST THE GREAT GREAT MOVIE	3.0
THERE ARE PARTS THAT ARE VERY INTENSE	0.0
I CAN SEE THAT	0.5
I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE GONNA LOVE IT	2.8
SO GO SEE THE EXPENDABLES	2.0
BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT IS A FAMILY FRIENDLY WARM AND FUZZY MOVIEVOOVIE	1.0
IT JUST IT FELT KIND OF CUT AND DRY 	-1.4
WHICH WOULD START THE PLANNING THAT I WISH IT HAS HAPPENED EARLIER IN THEIR CAREERS	-1.4
AND I DONT KNOW IF THIS SCENE TOOK PLACE FEFTEEN TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN THOSE GUYS WERE ABSOLUTELY PRIME IT WOULDVE BEEN JUST UM ABSOLUTELY BREATH TAKING MONUMENTAL MOMENT IN CINEMATIC HISTORY	-0.6
BUT SEEING IT TODAY NOW WHEN IT WAS REALLY NOTHING MORE THAN JUST A ONE XXX SHIP 	-1.2
IT LOST A LOT OF FEELING	-1.8
IT WASNT THE FINAL YOU KNOW FINALLY HAPPENED U UNITING THAT WE ALL COME TO EXPECT	0.8
AND ITS REALLY WHAT YOU WOULDVE EXPACT	-0.2
THERES LITTLE TO NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT ALL MOVIE	-2.4
ITS NOT A COMPELLING NARRATIVE BY ANY MEANS	-2.2
AND REALLY THERES NO HUMONGOUS TALE TO THESE GUYS 	-1.2
AND YET THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLY ENJOYABLE FOR ACTION FANS 	2.2
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DONT NEED A COMPLECATED FORMULA FOR AN ACTION MOVIE	-1.0
NOT A COMPLICATED STORY	-0.4
THIS MOVIE ESSENTIALLY WAS MADE FOR THREE REASONS IN MY OPINION	-0.25
THERES A BAD GUY GUY GO TAKE HIM DOWN THATS REALLY ALL YOU NEED	0.0
AND THATS YOU KNOW ALL THATS ALL YOU REALLY NEEDED TO DO	-0.2
THE FIRST REASON IS THE OBVIOUS JUST TO MAKE AN EXCITING ENJOYABLE ACTION FILM	1.6
THE SECOND REASON THIS MOVIE WAS MADE AND IN MY OPINION THE REAL REASON IT WAS MADE AGAIN ITS SILVESTRE STALONE TELLING HIMSELF I STILL GOT IT	-1.2
AND DEFINATELLY COMES THROUGH ON THAT	1.2
HES IN TERRIFIC SHAPE FOR A MAN TWICE MY AGE WHO LOOKS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN ME 	2.2
UM IVE GOT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT	1.0
BUT HEY WHATEVER AND IS SHOWING YEAH MAYBE HES NOT WHAT HE WAS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO BUT HE STILL HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE BILLED AS AN ACTION STAR	1.2
THATS KIND OF MADE ME FEEL DEPRESSED 	-1.6
BECAUSE YOU KNOW ITS BASICALLY IT WAS STALONE KNOWING THESE GUYS ARENT IN THE SHAPE THEY WERE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO 	1.2
THERES ACTUALLY YEAH YEAH SCENES TRIPLE STAND OFF WITH SILVESTRE ARNOLD SWARZENEGER BRUCE WILLIS AND YEAH ACTUALLY IN A WAY KIND OF FELL HOLLOW	-1.0
I MEAN YOU DONT SEE WHY THESE TWO PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER	-0.8
AND IT IS VERY RUSHED	-1.2
LIKE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SEPARATE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT BUT NONE WHERE THESE TWO SHOULD BE TOGETHER	-1.2
THERES NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT REALLY WITH THESE TWO	-2.0
YOU DONT SEE WHY THEY SHOULD LIKE EACH OTHER CAUSE THEY DONT SHOW IT IN THE MOVIE	-1.4
THERES NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD BE TOGETHER	-2.0
AND I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS GONNA BE REALLY GOOD BECAUSE MATT DAMON WAS IN IT	-0.75
LIKE THEY TALK FOR LIKE FIVE MINUTES AND INSTANTLY KISS WHICH IS DUMB 	-1.8
AND I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED	-2.6
BUT THEY DID NOT EXECUTE IT VERY WELL 	-2.2
WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THE CONCEPT WAS COOL	2.0
THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE FOR THESE REASONS 	-3.0
AND THEY LEFT A LOT OF PLOT HOLES	-2.0
YOU DONT FEEL THAT THESE TWO PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER	-1.4
NUMBER ONE BECAUSE THE LOVE IS FORCED	-1.2
