Installation
************

To install the repository, first clone the repository via Git, and then install the prerequisite packages through Conda:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda env create -f environment.yml

From there, you should be able to try out the example scripts
and the other code through running a Python kernel inside the repository folder.
